A summer of green apple trees, mowed lawns, and new sneakers. Of half-burnt firecrackers, of gathering dandelions, of Grandma's belly-busting dinner. It was a summer of sorrows and marvels and gold-fuzzed bees. A magical, timeless summer in the life of a twelve-year-old boy named Douglas Spaulding&#x2014;remembered forever by the incomparable Ray Bradbury.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>World-renowned fantasist Ray Bradbury has on several occasions stepped outside the arenas of horror, fantasy, and science fiction. An unabashed romantic, his first novel in 1957 was basically a love letter to his childhood. (For those who want to undertake an even more evocative look at the dark side of youth, five years later the author would write the chilling classic <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>.) <p> <i>Dandelion Wine</i> takes us into the summer of 1928, and to all the wondrous and magical events in the life of a 12-year-old Midwestern boy named Douglas Spaulding. This tender, openly affectionate story of a young man's voyage of discovery is certainly more mainstream than exotic. No walking dead or spaceships to Mars here. Yet those who wish to experience the unique magic of early Bradbury as a prose stylist should find <i>Dandelion Wine</i> most refreshing. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i></p>"Bradbury is an authentic original." -- <i>Time</i></p><h2>The Descendants: A Novel (Random House Movie Tie-In Books)</h2><p><p><b>Now a major motion picture starring George Clooney and directed by Alexander Payne<br></b><br>Fortunes have changed for the King family, descendants of Hawaiian royalty and one of the state&#x2019;s largest landowners. Matthew King&#x2019;s daughters&#x2014;Scottie, a feisty ten-year-old, and Alex, a seventeen-year-old recovering drug addict&#x2014;are out of control, and their charismatic, thrill-seeking mother, Joanie, lies in a coma after a boat-racing accident. She will soon be taken off life support. As Matt gathers his wife&#x2019;s friends and family to say their final goodbyes, a difficult situation is made worse by the sudden discovery that there&#x2019;s one person who hasn&#x2019;t been told: the man with whom Joanie had been having an affair. Forced to examine what they owe not only to the living but to the dead, Matt, Scottie, and Alex take to the road to find Joanie&#x2019;s lover, on a memorable journey that leads to unforeseen humor, growth, and profound revelations.<br></p></p><p><b>Kaui Hart Hemmings</b> is the author of the critically acclaimed short-story collection <i>House of Thieves</i>. Her work has been published in Z<i>oetrope, Best American New Voices</i>, and <i>Best American Nonrequired Reading</i>. Hemmings grew up in Hawaii and lives with her husband and daughter in San Francisco.1<br><br>the sun is shining, mynah birds are chattering, palm trees are swaying, so what. I&#x2019;m in the hospital and I&#x2019;m healthy. My heart is beating as it should. My brain is firing off messages that are loud and clear. My wife is on the upright hospital bed, positioned the way people sleep on airplanes, her body stiff, head cocked to the side. Her hands are on her lap.<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we lay her flat?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; my daughter Scottie says. She takes a picture of her mother, a Polaroid. She fans herself with the photo, and I press the button on the side of the bed to lower my wife&#x2019;s upper body. I release the button when she is almost flat on her back.<br><br>Joanie has been in a coma for twenty-three days, and in the next few days I&#x2019;ll have to make some decisions based on our doctor&#x2019;s final verdict. Actually, I&#x2019;ll just have to find out what the doctor has to say about Joanie&#x2019;s condition. I don&#x2019;t have any decisions to make, since Joanie has a living will. She, as always, makes her own decisions.<br><br>Today is Monday. Dr. Johnston said we&#x2019;ll talk on Tuesday, and this appointment is making me nervous, as though it&#x2019;s a romantic date. I don&#x2019;t know how to act, what to say, what to wear. I rehearse answers and reactions, but I&#x2019;ve nailed only the lines that respond to favorable scenarios. I haven&#x2019;t rehearsed Plan B.<br><br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; Scottie says. Her real name is Scottie. Joanie thought it would be cool to name her after Joanie&#x2019;s father, Scott. I have to disagree.<br><br>I look at the photo, which looks like those joke snapshots everyone takes of someone sleeping. I don&#x2019;t know why we think they&#x2019;re so funny. There&#x2019;s a lot that can be done to you while you&#x2019;re sleeping. This seems to be the message. Look how vulnerable you are, the things you aren&#x2019;t aware of. Yet in this picture you know she isn&#x2019;t just sleeping. Joanie has an IV and something called an endotracheal tube running out of her mouth to a ventilator that helps her breathe. She is fed through a tube and is administered enough medication to sustain a Fijian village. Scottie is documenting our life for her social studies class. Here&#x2019;s Joanie at Queen&#x2019;s Hospital, her fourth week in a coma, a coma that has scored a 10 on the Glasgow scale and a III on the Rancho Los Amigos scale. She was in a race and was launched from an offshore powerboat going eighty miles an hour, but I think she will be okay.<br><br>&#x201c;She reacts nonpurposefully to stimuli in a nonspecific manner, but occasionally, her responses are specific though inconsistent.&#x201d; This is what I&#x2019;ve been told by her neurologist, a young woman with a slight tremor in her left eye and a fast way of talking that makes it hard to ask questions. &#x201c;Her reflexes are limited and often the same, regardless of stimuli presented,&#x201d; she says. None of this sounds good to me, but I&#x2019;m assured Joanie&#x2019;s still holding on. I feel she&#x2019;ll be okay and one day able to function normally. I&#x2019;m generally right about things.<br><br>&#x201c;What was she racing for?&#x201d; the neurologist asked.<br><br>The question confused me. &#x201c;To win, I guess. To get to the end first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;shut this off,&#x201d; I tell Scottie. She finishes pasting the picture into her book then turns off the television with the remote.<br><br>&#x201c;No, I mean this.&#x201d; I point to the stuff in the window&#x2014;the sun and trees, the birds on the grass hopping from crumb to crumb thrown by tourists and crazy ladies. &#x201c;Turn this off. It&#x2019;s horrible.&#x201d; The tropics make it difficult to mope. I bet in big cities you can walk down the street scowling and no one will ask you what&#x2019;s wrong or encourage you to smile, but everyone here has the attitude that we&#x2019;re lucky to live in Hawaii; paradise reigns supreme. I think paradise can go fuck itself.<br><br>&#x201c;Disgusting,&#x201d; Scottie says. She slides the stiff curtain across the window, shutting all of it out.<br><br>I hope she can&#x2019;t tell that I&#x2019;m appraising her and that I&#x2019;m completely worried by what I see. She&#x2019;s excitable and strange. She&#x2019;s ten. What do people do during the day when they&#x2019;re ten? She runs her fingers along the window and mumbles, &#x201c;This could give me bird flu,&#x201d; and then she forms a circle around her mouth with her hand and makes trumpet noises. She&#x2019;s nuts. Who knows what&#x2019;s going on in that head of hers, and speaking of her head, she most definitely could use a haircut or a brushing. There are small tumbleweeds of hair resting on the top of her head. Where does she get haircuts? I wonder. Has she ever had one before? She scratches her scalp, then looks at her nails. She wears a shirt that says i&#x2019;m not that kind of girl. but i can be! I&#x2019;m grateful that she isn&#x2019;t too pretty, but I realize this could change.<br><br>I look at my watch. Joanie gave it to me.<br><br>&#x201c;The hands glow and the face is mother-of-pearl,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;How much did it cost?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;How did I know that would be the very first thing you said about it?&#x201d;<br><br>I could see she was hurt, that she put a lot of work into selecting the gift. She loves giving gifts, paying attention to people so she can give them a gift that says she took the time to know and listen to them. At least it seems like that&#x2019;s what she does. I shouldn&#x2019;t have asked about the price. She just wanted to show that she knew me.<br><br>&#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; Scottie asks.<br><br>&#x201c;Ten-thirty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s still early.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I say. I don&#x2019;t know what to do. We&#x2019;re here not only because we&#x2019;re visiting and hoping Joanie has made some progress during the night, reacting to light and sound and painful jabs, but also because we have nowhere else to go. Scottie&#x2019;s in school all day and then Esther picks her up, but this week I felt she should spend more time here and with me, so I took her out of school.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want to do now?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>She opens her scrapbook, a project that seems to occupy all of her time. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Eat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What would you usually do now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Be in school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What if it were Saturday? What would you do then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Beach.&#x201d;<br><br>I try to think of the last time she was completely in my care and what we did together. I think it was when she was around one, one and a half. Joanie had to fly to Maui for a shoot and couldn&#x2019;t find a babysitter, and her parents couldn&#x2019;t do it, for some reason. I was in the middle of a trial and stayed home but absolutely had to get some work done, so I put Scottie in the bathtub with a bar of soap. I watched to see what happened. She splashed and tried to drink the bathwater, and then she found the soap and reached to grab it. It eluded her grasp and she tried again, a look of wonder on her small face, and I slipped out into the hall, where I had set up a workstation and a baby monitor. I could hear her laughing, so I knew she wasn&#x2019;t drowning. I wonder if this would still work: putting her in a tub with a slippery bar of Irish Spring.<br><br>&#x201c;We can go to the beach,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Would Mom take you to the club?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, duh. Where else would we go?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s a plan. After you talk and we see a nurse, we&#x2019;ll check in at home, then go.&#x201d;<br><br>Scottie takes a picture out of her album, crushes it in her hand, and throws it away. I wonder what the picture was, if it was the one of her mother on the bed, probably not the best family relic. &#x201c;I wish,&#x201d; Scottie says. &#x201c;What do I wish?&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s one of our games. Every now and then she names a place she wishes we were besides this place, this time in our lives.<br><br>&#x201c;I wish we were at the dentist,&#x201d; she decides.<br><br>&#x201c;Me, too. I wish we were getting our mouths x-rayed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Mom was getting her teeth whitened,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>I really do wish we were at Dr. Branch&#x2019;s office, the three of us getting high on laughing gas and feeling our numb lips. A root canal would be a blast compared to this. Or any medical procedure, really. Actually, I wish I could be home working. I have to make a decision on who should own the land that has been in my family since the 1840s. This sale will eliminate all of my family&#x2019;s land holdings, and I desperately need to study up on the facts before the meeting I have with my cousins six days from now. That&#x2019;s our deadline. Two o&#x2019;clock at Cousin Six&#x2019;s house six days from today. We&#x2019;ll approve a buyer. It&#x2019;s irresponsible of me to have put off thinking about this deal for so long, but I guess this is what our family has done for a while now. We&#x2019;ve turned our backs to our legacy, waiting for someone else to come along and assume both our fortune and our debts.<br><br>I&#x2019;m afraid Esther may have to take Scottie to the beach, and I&#x2019;m about to tell her, but then I don&#x2019;t because I feel ashamed. My wife is in the hospital, my daughter needs her parents, and I need to work. Once again I&#x2019;m putting her in the tub.<br><br>I see Scottie staring at her mother. She has her back against the wall, and she&#x2019;s fumbling with the hem of her shirt.<br><br>&#x201c;Scottie,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re not going to say anything, then we may as well leave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to tell your mother what&#x2019;s going on in school?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She never cares about what&#x2019;s going on in school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about your extracurricular activities? Your schedule&#x2019;s fuller than the president&#x2019;s. Your scrapbook, show her that. Or what did you make in glassblowing the other day?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A bong,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>I look at her closely before responding. She doesn&#x2019;t appear to have said anything remarkable. I never know if she knows what she&#x2019;s talking about. &#x201c;Interesting,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;What is a bong?&#x201d;<br><br>She shrugs. &#x201c;Some high school guy taught me how to make it. He said it would go well with chips and salsa and any other food I could think of. It&#x2019;s some kind of platter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you still have this . . . bong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;But Mr. Larson told me to make it into a vase. I could put flowers in it and give it to her.&#x201d; She points at her mother.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a great idea!&#x201d;<br><br>She eyes me skeptically. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to get all Girl Scout about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I say.<br><br>I lean back in my chair and look at all the holes in the ceiling. I don&#x2019;t know why I&#x2019;m not worried, but I&#x2019;m just not. I know Joanie will be okay because she always makes it out okay. She will wake up and Scottie will have a mother and we can talk about our marriage and I can put my suspicions aside. I&#x2019;ll sell the property and buy Joanie a boat, something that will shock her and make her throw her head back and laugh.<br><br>&#x201c;Last time you were the one in the bed,&#x201d; Scottie says.<br><br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Last time you lied to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, Scottie. Forgive me.&#x201d;<br><br>She&#x2019;s referring to my stint in the hospital. I had a minor motorcycling accident. I crashed at the track, soaring over the handlebars into a pile of red dirt. At home, after the wreck, I told Joanie and Scottie what had happened but insisted I was okay and that I wasn&#x2019;t going to the hospital. Scottie issued me these little tests to demonstrate my unreliability. Joanie participated. They played bad cop, worse cop.<br><br>&#x201c;How many fingers?&#x201d; Scottie asked, holding up what I thought was a pinky and a thumb.<br><br>&#x201c;Balls,&#x201d; I said. I didn&#x2019;t want to be tested this way.<br><br>&#x201c;Answer her,&#x201d; Joanie said.<br><br>&#x201c;Two?&#x201d;</p><h2>God Laughs &amp; Plays: Churchless Sermons in Response to the Preachments of the Fundamentalist Right</h2><p>In God Laughs &amp; Plays, Duncan argues that the de facto political party embodied by the so-called "Christian Right" has turned worship into a self-righteous betrayal of the words and example of the very Jesus it claims to praise.

Burying himself in his success with breeding Thoroughbred racehorses, he's left his family to crumble and forgotten how to comfort his grieving children.<br><br>When a prized stallion arrives from Ireland crazed and unridable, Hunter is forced to seek help for the beast. Removed from the world of wealth and social privilege, Eliza Fylte has inherited her father's famed gift for gentling horses. And when Hunter arrives with his wild steed, her healing spirit reaches further yet, drawing her to his shattered family and to the intense, bitter man who needs her, just as she needs him.<br><br>Eliza understands what Hunter refuses to see...that love is the greatest healer of all. But can her kind, humble being manage to teach such an untethered man what truly matters in life?<br><br>A historical romance.</p><p>Setting: 1854 Virginia<br> Sensuality: 7<p> Southern plantation owner Hunter Calhoun gambles the success of his Virginia horse farm on an Irish stallion; unfortunately, the animal arrives crazed and unridable after the stormy sea crossing. Desperate, Hunter turns to Eliza Flyte, the horsemaster's daughter, who has inherited her father's gift for gentling horses. Her ability to heal wounded spirits with her compassion and wisdom is amazing, and when Hunter convinces her to leave her isolated island and return home with him, she soon applies that gift to the bitter man and his grieving, motherless children. But what future can a woman raised alone by her father with only the sea, animals, and a few books for companions have with a man who grew up as a rich, upper-class son of the South? It seems unlikely that Eliza could ever fit into Hunter's world and just as unlikely that he would give up his privileged life for her world. It just may take a miracle for these two mismatched lovers to find a way to live happily ever after.</p><p> In this novel, centered on the brother of the hero from the bestseller <i>The Charm School</i>, the cynical hero who has nearly given up on life is balanced by a heroine who has enough faith and wisdom for them both. The plot, blessedly free of clich�s, is unusual; just when the conclusion seems obvious, Wiggs tosses the reader a curve and with a few deft twists and turns, pulls off a terrific surprise ending. If you're only going to read one historical romance this week, make it this one. You'll be so glad you did. <i>--Lois Faye Dyer</i></p>Susan Wiggs is the author of many beloved bestsellers, including the popular Lakeshore Chronicles series.

Stacey Award</b><br><br>Tim Cook, Canada&#x2019;s leading war historian, ventures deep into World War Two in this epic two-volume story of heroism and horror, of loss and longing, sacrifice and endurance.<p>Written in Cook&#x2019;s compelling narrative style, this book shows in impressive detail how soldiers, airmen, and sailors fought&#x2014;the evolving tactics, weapons of war, logistics, and technology. It gauges Canadian effectiveness against the skilled enemy whom they confronted in battlefields from 1939 to 1943, from the sweltering heat of Sicily to the frigid North Atlantic, and from the urban warfare of Ortona to the dark skies over Germany. <i>The Necessary War</i> examines the equally important factors of morale, discipline, and fortitude of the Canadian citizen-soldiers.</p><p>The war was an engine of transformation for Canada. With a population of fewer than twelve million, Canada embraced its role as an arsenal of democracy, exporting war supplies, feeding its allies, and raising a million-strong armed forces that served and fought in nearly every theatre of war. The nation was mobilized like never before in the fight to preserve the liberal democratic order. The six-year-long exertion caused disruption, provoked nationwide industrialization, ushered in changes to gender roles, exacerbated the tension between English and French, and forged a new sense of Canadian identity. Canadians were willing to bear almost any burden and to pay the ultimate price in the pursuit of victory.</p><p>As with his award-winning two-volume series on WWI, Tim Cook uses original sources, letters from soldiers, rare documents, and maps of battlefields to illustrate the contributions and sacrifices made by what is often called the greatest generation. Magisterial in its scope, <i>The Necessary War</i> illuminates Canada&#x2019;s past as never before. From the Western Front to the home front, Canadians served many roles in a war that had to be fought and won.</p></p><p>TIM COOK is the Great War historian at the Canadian War Museum, as well as an adjunct professor at Carleton University. His books have won numerous awards, including the 2008 J.W. Dafoe Prize for <i>At the Sharp End </i>and the 2009 Charles Taylor Prize for Literary Non-Fiction for <i>Shock Troops. </i>In 2013, he received the Pierre Berton Award for popularizing Canadian history. He lives in Ottawa with his family.&#x201c;Cook deftly balances a bird's-eye-view of the tactics, doctrine, strategy, and key players at work (think of the sort of discussion best held over a large map) with the riveting accounts of the people on the ground." - <i>Globe and Mail</i><br><br>&#x201c;A genuinely captivating work of historical reportage and analysis.&#x201d; - <i>Globe and Mail</i><br><br>&#x201c;[An] engaging and well-researched addition to the mountain of military books on the war.&#x201d; - <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i></p><h2>The Norman Rockwell Illustrated Cookbook: Classic American Recipes</h2><p>This collection of more than two hundred classic American recipes is complemented by more than sixty Norman Rockwell paintings, which capture the essence and spirit of America</p><p></p><h2>A History of Marshall</h2><p>Oversize hardcover (brown) and dust jacket, as pictured (please see my image); shelf-type rubbing on base of spine (am)</p><p></p><h2>Shackleton</h2><p>Ernest Shackleton was the quintessential Edwardian hero. A contemporary - and adversary - of Scott, he sailed on the &#39;Discovery&#39; expedition of 1900, and went on to mount three expeditions of his own. Like Scott, he was a social adventurer; snow and ice held no particular attraction, but the pursuit of wealth, fame and power did. Yet Shackleton, and Anglo-Irishman who left school at 16, needed status to raise money for his own expeditions. At various times he was involved in journalism, politics, manufacturing and City fortune-hunting - none of them very effectively. A frustrated poet, he was never to be successful with money, but he did succeed in marrying it. At his height he was feted as a national hero, knighted by Edward VII, and granted £20,000 by the government for achievements which were, and remain, the very stuff of legend. But the world to which he returned in 1917 after the sensational &#39;Endurance&#39; expedition did not seem to welcome surviving heroes. Poverty-stricken by the end of the war, he had to pay off his debts through writing and endless lecturing. He finally obtained funds for another expedition, but dies of a heart attack, aged only 47, at it reached South Georgia.</p><p>Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Anglo-Irish explorer, never achieved his goal of reaching the South Pole, though he was knighted in 1909 for having come within 100 miles. With bravery matched only by his theatricality, Shackleton sought to top that accomplishment by landing on one side of Antarctica and traveling the width of the icy continent by sledge. What might have been a great exploratory journey turned into a raw struggle for survival when his ship became trapped in pack ice, and he was forced to lead his team on a desperate trek across hundreds of miles of the world's most dangerous terrain. He made it home, but even his stature as one of Edwardian England's greatest heroes could not save Shackleton from financial risk taking; he ended his life mired in debt.

He lives in Arizona.1<br>THE PRESENT DAY<br>EIGHT IN THE evening. From out of the south, like a dark insect crawling over a wrinkled blue tablecloth, a tired old cargo ship pushed her way through the Caribbean swells toward the entrance of Santiago Harbor on the isle of Cuba. The exhaust from her single funnel drifted in a blue haze under an easterly breeze as the sun settled below the western horizon and became a ponderous orange ball magnified by the earth's atmosphere.<br>She was one of the last tramp steamers, a cargo ship that traveled the sea anonymously to the exotic and far-flung ports of the world. There were few left in operation. They did not follow a regular shipping route. Their schedules depended on the demands of their cargo and its owners, so their destinations changed from port to port. They coasted in, unloaded their freight and sailed away like wraiths in the night.<br>Two miles from shore, a small boat slapped over the rolling sea, approached the ship and swung around on a parallel course. The pilot closed on the rust-streaked hull as a boarding ladder was thrown down from an open hatch.<br>The pilot, a man in his fifties with brown skin and thick gray hair, stared up at the ancient ship. Her black paint was faded and badly needed to be chipped away and repainted. Streams of rust flowed from every opening in the hull. The huge anchor, pulled tightly in its hawsehole, was completely covered by corrosion. The pilot read the letters, barely discernible on the upper bow. The weary old freighter was named Oregon.<br>Jesus Morales shook his head in amazement. It was a miracle the ship hadn't been scrapped twenty years ago, he mused. She looked more like a derelict than a cargo carrier still in service. He wondered if the party bureaucrats in the Ministry of Transportation had any idea of the condition of the ship they had contracted to bring in a cargo of chemical fertilizer for the sugar and tobacco fields. He could not believe the ship had passed maritime insurance inspection.<br>As the ship slowed almost to a dead stop, Morales stood at the railing and the pilot boat's bumpers squeezed against the freighter's hull. Timing the crest of a wave as it lifted the boat, Morales leaped agilely from the wet deck onto the boarding ladder and climbed to the hatch. It was a function he performed as often as ten times a day. A pair of crewmen were waiting beside the hatch and helped him up on the deck. The two were both burly-looking individuals, and they did not bother to smile in greeting. One simply pointed toward the ladder leading to the bridge. Then they turned and left Morales standing alone on the deck. Watching them walk away, Morales hoped that he'd never have to meet them in a dark alley.<br>He paused before climbing the ladder and took a few moments to study the upper works of the ship.<br>From his long experience and knowledge of ships, he judged her length at 560 feet, with a 75-foot beam. Probably a gross tonnage around 11,000. Five derricks, two behind the funnel and superstructure and three on the forward deck, stood waiting to unload her cargo. He counted six holds with twelve hatches. In her prime, she would have been classed as an express cargo liner. He guessed that she had been built and launched in the early 1960s. The flag on her stern was Iranian. Not a registry Morales had seen very often.<br>If the Oregon looked shabby from the waterline, she looked downright squalid from her main deck. Rust covered every piece of deck machinery from winches to chains, but the hardware at least appeared to be in usable condition. By comparison, the derricks looked as if they hadn't been operated in years.<br>To add further insult, battered drums, tools and what could only be described as junked equipment were scattered around the decks. In all his years as a harbor pilot, Morales had never seen a ship in such filthy condition.<br>He climbed the ladder steps leading to the bridge, past bulkheads with flaking paint and portholes whose lenses were cracked and yellowed. Then he paused before finally swinging the door open. The interior of the vessel was as bad, if not worse. The wheelhouse was dirty, with the scars of cigarette burns on the counters and on what had once been a polished teak deck. Dead flies littered the windowsills, the smell assaulted his nose. And then there was the captain.<br>Morales was greeted by a great slob of a man with an immense stomach that sagged over his belt line. The face was scarred, and the nose so badly broken it slanted toward the left cheek. The thick black hair was plastered back with some kind of greasy cream and his beard was scruffy and stringy. The captain was a cacophony of colors. His eyes were red and his teeth yellow-brown, while his arms were covered with blue tattoos. A grimy yachtsman's cap sat perched on the back of his head and he wore dingy coveralls. The tropical heat and the humidity on the non-air-conditioned bridge made it obvious to Morales that the man had not bathed for at least a month. Any dog worth his salt would have tried to bury the man.<br>He extended a sweaty hand to Morales and spoke in English. &#x201c;Glad to see you. I'm Captain Jed Smith.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus Morales. Pilot for the Harbor Office of Santiago.&#x201d; Morales felt uncomfortable. Smith spoke English with an American accent--not what he'd expected on a ship of Iranian registry.<br>Smith handed him a packet of papers. &#x201c;Here's our registration and cargo manifest.&#x201d;<br>Morales merely cast a brief glance at the documents. Officials on the docks would study them more closely. His only concern was that the ship had permission to enter the port. He handed back the packet and said, &#x201c;Shall we proceed?&#x201d;<br>Smith waved a hand toward a wooden helm that somehow seemed terribly old-fashioned for a ship built in the sixties. &#x201c;She's all yours, Senor Morales. What dock do you want us to moor at?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There are no docks available until Thursday. You will have to anchor in the middle of the harbor until then.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That's four days from now. We have a schedule to meet. We can't sit around for four days waiting to unload our cargo.&#x201d;<br>Morales shrugged. &#x201c;I have no control over the harbormaster. Besides, the docks are full with ships unloading new farm machinery and automobiles, now that the embargo has been lifted. These have priority over your cargo.&#x201d;<br>Smith threw up his hands. &#x201c;All right. I guess it's not the first time we had to twiddle our thumbs waiting to unload.&#x201d; He gave a broad, rotten-toothed grin. &#x201c;I guess me and my crew will just have to come ashore and make friends with your Cuban women.&#x201d;<br>The thought made Morales's skin crawl. Without further conversation, he stepped over to the helm as Smith called the engine room and ordered half speed. The pilot felt the engine's vibrations through the deck as the tired old ship began to make way again, and he aimed her bow toward the narrow entrance of Santiago Harbor, which was bordered by high bluffs that rose from the sea.<br>From offshore, the channel that led inside to the bellows-shaped harbor was invisible until a ship was nearly on top of it. Rising two hundred feet atop the cliffs on the right stood the old colonial fortress known as Morro Castle.<br>Morales noticed that Smith and the members of his mangy crew standing on the bridge seemed interested in the defenses that had been dug into the hillside when Fidel Castro had thought the United States was going to attack Cuba. They studied the gun and missile emplacements through expensive binoculars.<br>Morales smiled to himself. Let them look all they wanted most of the defenses were deserted. Only two small fortresses maintained a small company of soldiers to man the missile emplacements in the unlikely event an unwelcome vessel tried to enter the harbor.<br>Morales threaded his way through the buoys and steered the Oregon deftly around the twists and turns of the channel, which soon opened into the broad, ball-shaped harbor surrounded by the city of Santiago. The wheel felt strange to him, though. The odd feeling was barely perceptible, but there nonetheless. Whenever he turned the wheel, there seemed to be a short lag before the rudder responded. He made a quick but very slight turn to starboard before bringing the wheel back to port. It was definitely there, almost like an echo, a two-second delay. He did not sense sluggishness from the steering machinery, but rather a pause. It had to come from another origin. Yet when the response came, it was quick and firm. But why the hesitation?<br>&#x201c;Your helm has an off feel to it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Smith grunted. &#x201c;It's been that way for a few days. Next port we enter with a shipyard, I'll have the spindles on the rudder looked at.&#x201d;<br>It still made no sense to Morales, but the ship was entering the open part of the bay off the city now, and he pushed the mystery from his mind. He called the harbor officials over the ship's radio and kept them informed of his progress, and was given orders for the anchorage.<br>Morales pointed out the buoys to Smith that marked the mooring area and ordered the ship brought to slow speed. He then swung the stern around until the bow was facing the incoming tide before ordering all stop. The Oregon slowed to a halt in an open area between a Canadian container ship and a Libyan oil tanker.<br>&#x201c;You may drop your anchor,&#x201d; he said to Smith, who acknowledged with a nod as he held a loudspeaker in front of his face.<br>&#x201c;Let go anchor!&#x201d; he shouted at his crew. The command was answered a few seconds later by the rattling clatter of the chain links against the hawsehole, followed by a great splash as the anchor plunged into the water. The bow of the ship became hazy from the cloud of dust and rust that burst from the chain locker.<br>Morales released his grip on the worn spokes of the wheel and turned to Smith. &#x201c;You will, of course, pay the pilot's fee when you turn over your documents to the harbor officials.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why wait?&#x201d; snorted Smith. He reached into a pocket of his coveralls and produced a wad of crinkled American hundred-dollar bills. He counted out fifteen bills, then hesitated, looked into Morales's shocked expression, and said, &#x201c;Oh, what the heck, suppose we make it an even two thousand dollars.&#x201d;<br>Without the least indecision, Morales took the bills and slipped them into his wallet.<br>&#x201c;You are most generous, Captain Smith. I will notify the officials that the pilot's fee was paid in full.&#x201d;<br>Smith signed the required affidavits and logged the mooring. He put a massive arm around the Cuban's shoulder. &#x201c;Now about them girls. Where's a good place in Santiago to meet them?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The cabarets on the waterfront are where you'll find both cheap entertainment and drinks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I'll tell my crew.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good-bye, Captain.&#x201d; Morales did not extend his hand. He already felt unclean just by being on board the ship; he could not bring himself to grip the greasy hand of the obnoxious captain. Morales's easygoing Cuban warmth had been cooled by the surroundings and he didn't want to waste another second on board the Oregon. Leaving the wheelhouse, he dropped down the ladder to the deck and descended to the waiting pilot boat, still stunned at experiencing the filthiest ship he had ever piloted into the harbor. Which is just what the owners of the Oregon wanted him to think.<br>If Morales had examined the ship more closely, he might have realized it was all a facade. The Oregon rode low in the water because of specially fitted ballast tanks, which when filled with water lowered the hull to make it look as though it were loaded with cargo. Even the engine tremors were mechanically staged. The ship's engines were whisper-silent and vibrationless.<br>And the coating of rust throughout the ship? It was artistically applied paint.<br>SATISFIED THAT THE pilot and his boat had pulled away from the Oregon, Captain Smith stepped over to a handrail mounted on the deck that did not seem to serve any particular purpose. He gripped it and pressed a button on the underside. The square section of the deck on which Smith was standing suddenly began descending until it stopped in a vast, brightly lit room filled with computers, automated controls and several large consoles containing communications and weapons-firing systems. The deck in the command center was richly carpeted, the walls were paneled in exotic woods and the furniture looked as if it had come straight from a designer's showroom. This room was the real heart of the Oregon.<br>The six people four men and two women neatly dressed in shorts, flowered shirts and white blouses were busy manning the various systems. One woman was scanning an array of TV monitors that covered every section of Santiago Bay, while a man zoomed a camera on the pilot boat as it turned and headed into the main channel. No one bothered to give the fat captain half a glance. Only a man dressed in khaki shorts and a green golf shirt approached him.<br>&#x201c;All go well with the pilot?&#x201d; asked Max Hanley, the ship's corporate president, who directed all operational systems, including the ship's engines.<br>&#x201c;The pilot noticed the delay in the helm.&#x201d;<br>Hanley grinned. &#x201c;If only he'd known he was steering a dead wheel. We'll have to make some adjustments, though. You speak to him in Spanish?&#x201d;<br>Smith smiled. &#x201c;My best Yankee English. Why let him know I speak his language? That way, I could tell if he played any tricks over the radio with the harbor officials as we anchored.&#x201d; Smith pulled back a sleeve of his grimy coveralls and checked a Timex watch with a badly scratched lens. &#x201c;Thirty minutes until dark.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The equipment in the moon pool is all ready.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And the landing crew?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Standing by.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I just have time to get rid of these smelly clothes and get decent,&#x201d; said Cabrillo, heading toward his cabin down a hallway hung with paintings by modern artists.<br>The crew cabins were concealed inside two of the cargo holds and were as plush as rooms in a five-star hotel. There was no separation between officers and crew on the Oregon. All were educated people, highly trained in their respective fields elite men and women who had served in the armed forces. The ship was owned by its staff, who were stockholders. There were no ranks. Cabrillo was chairman; Hanley, president; the others held various other titles. They were all mercenaries, here to make a profit though that did not necessarily rule out good works at the same time hired by countries or large companies to perform clandestine services around the world, very often at great risk.<br>THE MAN WHO left the cabin twenty minutes later did not look like the man who'd entered. The greasy hairpiece, scruffy beard and grimy coveralls were gone, as was the foul smell. So was the Timex, now replaced with a stainless-steel Concord chronograph. In addition, the man had dropped at least a hundred pounds.<br>Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo had transformed himself from the grimy sea dog Smith to his true self again. A tall man in his forties, ruggedly handsome, he stared through pixie-blue eyes. His blond hair was trimmed in a crew cut and a western cowboy-style mustache sprouted from his upper lip.<br>He hurried down the corridor to a far door and entered a control room perched high inside a vast cavern in the hull amidships. The three-deck-high moon pool, as it was called, was where all the Oregon&#x2019;s underwater equipment was stored diving gear; submersibles, manned and unmanned; and an array of underwater electronic sensors. A pair of state-of-the-art contemporary underwater craft by U.S. Submarines a sixty-five-foot Nomad 1000 and a thirty-two-foot Discovery 1000 hung in cradles. The doors on the bottom of the hull slid open and water flooded in until it was level with the outer waterline.<br>The remarkable ship was not what she appeared from her exterior. The outer decks and hull were disguised to make her look like a rust bucket. The whee...</p><h2>Flying Boats: The J-Class Yachts of Aviation</h2><p>In 1930, airfields were a rarity. Aircraft companies, given the unreliability of internal combustion engines, primitive avionics, and unpredictable weather, believed that an airplane could carry its landing strip with it, if the field were water. The brief but brilliant age of flying boats was born. Master maritime artist Ian Marshall captures these magnificent machines in perfect detail.</p><p></p><h2>Joyride: Includes the Bonus Novella Weed Species</h2><p>Hoping to escape from her abusive ex-husband, a woman and her lover successfully carry out their plot to murder him, only to find themselves at the mercy of an obsessive, twisted stranger who witnessed the crime.</p><p>Jack Ketchum is the pseudonym for a former actor, singer, teacher, literary agent, lumber salesman, and soda jerk. He is also a former flower child and baby boomer who figures that in 1956 Elvis, dinosaurs and horror probably saved his life. His first novel, Off Season, prompted the Village Voice to publicly scold its publisher in print for publishing violent pornography. He personally disagrees but is perfectly happy to let you decide for yourself. His short story The Box won a 1994 Bram Stoker Award from the HWA and he has written ten novels, including <i>The Girl Next Door, Off Season</i>, and Stranglehold. His stories are collected in <i>The Exit At Toledo Blade Boulevard</i> and <i>Broken on the Wheel of Sex. </i>Sex, murder and mayhem are stock in trade for the vastly popular Ketchum (The Girl Next Door), and so are odd coincidences, which abound in this gory reissue. Wayne, a bartender and would-be killer who always chickens out at the last minute, nearly chokes his girl-friend to death while on a hike. After she runs off, he happens to see a couple committing a brutal murder and recognizes one of them as a regular at his bar. The dead man, Howard-done in by his ex-wife, Carole, and her new lover, Lee-is found in a stream by a Boy Scout who is dispassionately curious about the stinking corpse. The pathways coalesce when Wayne forces Lee and Carole into a meaningless drive inevitably complete with senseless murder. These are the actors that make Ketchum's melodrama compelling, nasty but peculiarly irresistible. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Grace Strasser-Mendana controls much of the country's wealth and knows virtually all of its secrets; Charlotte Douglas knows far too little. "Immaculate of history, innocent of politics," she has come to Boca Grande vaguely and vainly hoping to be reunited with her fugitive daughter.

Afterword by Barbara Wagstaff.</p><p>Known for her spiritually questing novels, her supernatural stories and her flaming red hair, Mary Butts consorted in London and Paris literary circles wth Hemingway, Cocteau, Ford Madox Ford and the Bloomsbury clique. Her fiction and her poetry are today in near-total eclipse. This flowery autobiography was first published in a truncated version in 1937, the year she died. Butts's daughter, Camilla Bagg, has edited the present complete edition, restoring such traumatic incidents as the false accusations by the novelist's mother that she made passes at her stepfather. Most of the narrative centers on Salterns, the provincial estate where she grew up. This memoir is a sensitive woman's meticulous account of her evolving consciousness from sheltered child to independent writer. Regrettably, it is also priggish, sermonizing, querulous, full of unresolved conflicts over authority figures and written in a dated, suffocatingly ornate style. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Butts (1890-1937) grew up as a privileged Edwardian. She recalled her childhood as literally magical, an initiation into the mysteries of nature and imagination that was stimulated by Salterns, a fine estate whose house boasted many books and a collection of William Blake's art. Her preoccupation with language was encouraged by her gifted father, but his death during her adolescence brought disaster: mother remarried, books destroyed, Blakes sold. The shock to her rather mystical temperament was permanent, informing her life and work as she gained literary recognition in the Twenties and Thirties. Women's studies and post-World War I literature collections will want her memoir/meditation, appearing only now in its entirety. Starr E. Smith, Georgetown Univ.

It is a system of electrical poles, wire, substations, hydroelectric dams, telecommunication towers, and water extraction and sewage systems. From within this system we work, play, and raise families. We have also created one of the greatest environmental challenges known to modern civilization. The signs of our impact upon the world can be recognized in the reports of environmental changes occurring across the earth, and they can also be seen in the growing failures of the energy grids across the world as the current system is stressed beyond its capacity. <br> Technologies that can be used to live off the grid (geothermal energy use, wind turbines, photovoltaic arrays, micro hydropower, rainwater collection and reclamation, and more) are explained as author Lori Ryker shows how to choose and incorporate these sources according to geography and climate. <br> Off the Grid beautifully illustrates that this is not just a concept for rural living; examples of homes that are "off the grid" to varying degrees are found in New York City; Ontario, Canada; Stuttgart, Germany; Belmont, California; Pipe Creek, Texas; Clyde Park, Montana; Twin Lakes, Minnesota; Laytonville, California; Venice, California; and New South Wales, Australia. <br> Off the Grid shows how we can take responsibility for our future choices and conveniences now, and proves that off-the-grid living is a concept that can be easily understood and adopted by everyone, regardless of where you live or how much money you make. <br> Lori Ryker grew up in Texas and has lived and worked in a variety of locations, including Boston, New York City, Portland, and Basel, Switzerland. She now resides in Livingston, Montana, where she teaches in the School of Architecture at Montana State University and is a partner, along with Brett W. Nave, of Ryker/Nave Design. Their work has been published in The House You Build, and Western Interiors and Design. Ryker holds a MArch from Harvard Graduate School of Design and a Ph.D. from Texas A &amp; M University.

Both <i>Uglies</i> and <i>Peeps</i> were named Best Books for Young Adults by the American Library Association in 2006. Read his exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>:</b> <br> <p> </p><p>Teenagers love a good apocalypse. Who doesn't? All those annoying rules suspended. Society's pretenses made irrelevant. Malls to be looted. School out forever.</p> <p>But in <i>The Forest and Hands and Teeth</i>, Carrie Ryan's marvelous debut novel, the post-apocalypse is defined more by constraints than freedoms. The book begins seven generations after the Return, an undead plague that has ended civilization as we know it. Of course, a zombie outbreak usually means shotguns and mall looting--the very essence of freedom. But more than a century on from the Return, the malls have already been looted, and shotguns are a distant memory. The novel's heroine, Mary, lives in a village surrounded by one last vestige of industrial technology: a chain-link fence, beyond which is a vast forest full of shambling, eternally ravenous undead--the forest of hands and teeth. No villager ever goes outside this fence, unless they want to die. (And given this bleak scenario, some do.)</p> <p>Mary's world is bounded not only by the fence but by the archaic traditions of her people, which are enforced by a religious order called the Sisterhood. Marriages, childbirth, death, every stage of life must be controlled to sustain the village's precarious existence. Even the houses are circumscribed--literally--with passages of scripture carved into every entrance to remind the inhabitants of the rules that sustain human life amid the horrors of the forest. </p> <p>After so long an isolation, the village is beginning to forget. Some doubt that there really was a time before the Return, with giant cities and wondrous technologies. Others believe that nothing at all exists beyond the forest of hands and teeth. And nobody but Mary and her slightly mad mother believes in something called "the ocean," a huge and unbounded space beyond the reach of the undead.</p> <p>Mary is the sort of teenager who dreams of bigger things. Not just the ocean, but epic romance and adventure beyond the fence, maybe even other villages somewhere out there, safe behind their own fences. She believes that answers can be found to questions like, What made the Return happen? And what was it like before?</p> <p>Escaping the confines of home for the greater world is, of course, one of the great themes of teen literature. But few heroes in any genre have faced an obstacle as daunting as the forest of hands and teeth. Though Ryan's writing is as lyrical as her title, this novel is driven by the same grim relentlessness that animates any good zombie film. Elegant prose and undead hordes combine to create a story where high drama feels completely unforced, where tension is constant, and where an image as simple as the open sea is achingly romantic.</p> <p>Zombies have been metaphors for many things: consumerism, contagion in an overpopulated world, the inevitability of death. But here they resonate with a particularly teenage realization about the world--that social limits and backward traditions are numberless and unstoppable, no matter how shambling they may seem at first.</p> <p>And yet we must try to escape them anyway, lest we wither inside the fence.<i>--Scott Westerfeld</i> </p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Carrie Ryan</strong> <p></p> We had the opportunity to chat with Carrie Ryan over e-mail about her first novel, <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>. Here&#x2019;s what Carrie had to say about George Romero, the growing popularity of young adult fiction, and how she's preparing for the zombie apocalypse. <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> You have said you began your writing career intending to write &#x201c;chick lit.&#x201d; How, then, did you come to write <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>, which, on first glance, is a far cry from that genre? </p> <p><b>Carrie Ryan:</b> In college many of the short stories I wrote were fairly dark but I&#x2019;d always heard the advice that you should write what you read and at the time I loved to read romantic comedies and chick lit. So when I decided to attempt a novel, that&#x2019;s what I tried to write even though it didn&#x2019;t fit my natural tone. In fact, when I first tried to write a romantic comedy I had to constantly pull myself away from writing dark (and the reason I never tried to sell that book is because too many characters die which wasn&#x2019;t very comedic!). Even the young adult chick lit I was working on tended to be dark--the main character interned at a coroners office and was surrounded by death.</p> <p>So writing <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i> was more of me embracing my true voice. I think I&#x2019;d been scared to just indulge in it before, afraid that there wouldn&#x2019;t be a market for it (and in fact, even when I was writing <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i> I was convinced it wasn&#x2019;t saleable). As soon as I jotted down the first line I decided to write it the way I wanted--to experiment and push the bounds and not worry about the market or what other people would think. This was the story I realized I had to tell when my fianc� suggested, &#x201c;write what you love.&#x201d;</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Your book has drawn inevitable comparison to the archetypal zombie flick, <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>. How does Mary&#x2019;s world differ from the world George Romero created more than 40 years ago? Are the movies what first got you hooked on zombies?</p> <p> <b>Ryan:</b> George Romero has really sparked a lot of imaginations and while any book or movie with zombies inevitably owes a massive debt to Romero's world, I tend not to think of <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i> as a "zombie book," but rather a book that happens to have zombies in it. <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>, which takes place generations after the apocalypse, is really about a girl struggling with growing up, desire, and a controlling society set against the backdrop of a world with zombies (called &#x201c;Unconsecrated&#x201d;) constantly pushing against the fences. The characters have already come to terms with the Return (the zombie apocalypse) and know nothing else: this is their world and they've accepted it.</p> <p>Romero's movies, on the other hand, deal more directly with the zombies--the plot arc of <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> is having to reckon with and defend against a zombie apocalypse as it occurs. In Romero's world the characters are still trying to fight against the zombies, still trying to reclaim the world of "before." In my book, the "before" time is lost, beyond memory, and the Unconsecrated are not so much the focal point as a part of the setting.</p> <p>I do think watching the remake of <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> sparked my interest in zombies and led to my watching other zombie movies, including Romero's. One of the things I love the best about his movies, and something that inspired me, is that while they may appear to be simply zombie flicks on the surface, they're actually a commentary on society and are often a reflection of societal fears.</p> <p>Like many other authors and directors, I wanted to use zombies as a mirror for the characters in my book. In the end, though, what influenced me most was the idea of a girl growing up trapped in a village that has forgotten everything and her hope that there could be something more beyond the menace in the Forest surrounding them, and that's what <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i> is really about.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Many young adult books with post-apocalyptic settings have been gaining a wide adult fan base--Suzanne Collins&#x2019;s <i>The Hunger Games</i> and Susan Beth Pfeffer&#x2019;s <i>Life As We Knew It</i> are a couple of examples. Why do you think these books are attracting a wider audience?</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> It&#x2019;s been really exciting to see so many young adult books find such popularity with adult readers and I&#x2019;ve loved re-introducing both my mom and sister to the young adult section. In the past I think readers have &#x201c;graduated&#x201d; to adult books and there&#x2019;s been this feeling that young adult books are &#x201c;just for teens&#x201d; and are therefore somehow lighter and less substantive. While there have always been phenomenal young adult books published every year, it&#x2019;s really felt like there&#x2019;s been a renaissance recently: more books that are pushing the boundaries in every way. </p> <p>Not only are a lot of sophisticated young adult books being published, but they&#x2019;re accessible to everyone--most adults can remember those years of their life and tap into those emotions and feelings. But even more, so many of these books also tap into adult emotions and feelings: how to survive, figuring out what matters in life, struggling with changing relationships. These books make us question our decisions and ourselves and, especially in the current atmosphere of apprehension in the world, people are looking inward to what really matters to them.</p> <p>Ultimately, I like to think that the bottom line is there are just really really great books in the young adult section and that great books will find a wide audience, no matter where they&#x2019;re placed.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> <i>In The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>, no one seems to know how the Unconsecrated (the zombies that live outside the village gates) first came into existence. What do you suspect would trigger the zombie apocalypse?</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> This is actually one of my favorite parts of any zombie book or movie: seeing how the apocalypse is triggered. There are so many different ways it can happen (and has happened)! Aliens, s�ances, military and medical experiments gone wrong, parasites, environmental mishaps. You name it, it&#x2019;s caused the zombie apocalypse (I&#x2019;m still waiting for a movie with chocolate overindulgence as the trigger!)</p> <p>But I actually made a conscious decision to leave the cause of the Return a mystery in <i>The Forest of Hands and Teeth</i>. One reason is that I wanted to show how knowledge and history could erode so drastically over time. The characters in my book have been so isolated and controlled that they think the ocean is a myth; they have no conception of the world before the Return.</p> <p>Ultimately, I recognized that the cause of the Return doesn&#x2019;t matter to the characters or the story. There are so many books and movies that focus on why and how such an apocalypse occurs but my book takes place so long after the event that it&#x2019;s meaningless. I really wanted to draw that distinction between my world and other zombie worlds: that it doesn&#x2019;t matter how or why or what triggered the zombie apocalypse, just that it happened and that&#x2019;s the world they live in now.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> So, how are you preparing for the zombie apocalypse?</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> We&#x2019;re not at all prepared! It&#x2019;s funny, shortly after seeing my first zombie movie I dreamt there was a zombie apocalypse and how I would handle it if stuck in the apartment I was living in at the time. Even after waking up I kept trying to figure out how I would survive (how to defend myself, get water, find help, etc.). I&#x2019;ve since thought through similar issues with every place we&#x2019;ve lived sort of as a fun thought experiment and I&#x2019;ve come to the conclusion that we were much safer when we lived in a top floor apartment than our one-story house with too many windows!</p> <p>To prepare, I just continue to read books, watch movies and am currently trying to train my puppy to be a zombie-sniffing dog.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CARRIE RYAN is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of The Forest of Hands and Teeth trilogy that includes The Forest of Hands and Teeth, The Dead-Tossed Waves, The Dark and Hollow Places, and the original ebook Hare Moon.

Written in the fourteenth century, this text is the first volume of Longchenpa&#x2019;s Trilogy of Rest, a work of the Tibetan Dzogchen tradition. This profound and comprehensive presentation of the Buddhist view and path combines the scholastic expository method with direct pith instructions designed for yogi practitioners. <br><br> This first part of the Trilogy of Rest sets the foundation for the following two volumes: <i>Finding Rest in Meditation</i>, which focuses on Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice, and <i>Finding Rest in Illusion</i>, which focuses on post-meditation yogic conduct. The Padmakara Translation Group has provided us with a clear and fluid new translation to <i>Finding Rest in the Nature of the Mind</i> along with selections from its autocommentary, <i>The Great Chariot</i>, which will serve as a genuine aid to study and meditation. <br><br>Here, we find essential instructions on the need to turn away from materialism, how to find a qualified guide, how to develop boundless compassion for all beings, along with the view of tantra and associated meditation techniques. The work culminates with pointing out the result of practice as presented from the Dzogchen perspective, providing us with all the tools necessary to traverse the Tibetan Buddhist path of finding rest.</p><p>LONGCHEN RABJAM (1308&#x2013;1363), also known as Longchenpa, is a great luminary of Tibetan Buddhism. He was highly skilled in all aspects of scholarship from an early age and excelled throughout his life in the practice and accomplishment of the Dharma. Regarded as a great Dzogchen master, Longchenpa had many pure visions where he was given direct instructions from Guru Padmasambhava and is recognized as an emanation of Vimalamitra. Longchenpa&#x2019;s prolific writings have made him one of Tibet&#x2019;s most renowned and precious teachers.<br> &nbsp;<br> The PADMAKARA TRANSLATION GROUP, based in France, has a distinguished reputation for all its translations of Tibetan texts and teachings. Its work has been published in several languages and is renowned for its clear and accurate literary style.&#x201c;Rest is what we all lack most. Even more agonizing is that we don&#x2019;t know how to do it; in fact, we don&#x2019;t even understand what it means to rest. Who but Longchenpa can and will make absolutely sure that we finally understand what rest is?&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In his stunningly poetic exposition, the <i>Trilogy of Rest</i>, Gyalwa Longchenpa illumines the great path to enlightenment with unsurpassable depth and detail. Volume 1 of the trilogy, <i>Finding Rest in the Nature of the Mind</i>, sets us upon that path, grounding us from our very first steps through to the profound&#x2014;showing the most profound to be grounded in unshakable simplicity. Brilliantly clarifying the complexities we create to come to this realization, Longchenpa easily and clearly reveals the concordance of the journey&#x2019;s various stages. <br><br> This new translation of one of the greatest classics of the Nyingma School is wonderfully accessible and a most welcome contribution filled with the rich biographical and historical details of Longchenpa&#x2019;s own journey.

But an equally valid, though lesser known outcome of trauma is post-traumatic growth. While many survivors suffer long-term emotional damage, over the last several decades psychologists have discovered that with the right circumstances and proper support, survivors can actually emerge from their trauma stronger, more focused, and with a new and clear vision for the future. In fact, as many as two-thirds of trauma survivors report positive changes&#x2014;far more than suffer from PTSD.<br> <br>But how can terrible events lead to remarkable and dramatic breakthroughs? <i>Upside</i> seeks to answer this question by taking a deep-dive look at this burgeoning new field of study. Comprised of interviews with leading researchers and dozens of trauma survivors, Rendon paints a vivid and comprehensive portrait of this groundbreaking field. With accessible language, prescriptive takeaways, and specific tools to promote positive responses to trauma, this book is perfect for anyone interested in the ways that traumatic events shape people. It is particularly useful for trauma survivors or their loved ones seeking a more hopeful and positive future.</p><p>Jim Rendon is a graduate of the journalism school at UC Berkeley.

He loved that bike. Delp, who was fifty-nine years old at the time, had just put a thousand-dollar LED light system on the motorcycle so it could flash a multicolored glow on the road as he barreled down the highway. Even the wheels lit up. That spring morning he was on his way to Daytona Bike Week to buy a motorcycle for his wife, Debbie.<br> <br>As Delp idled at the stoplight, a woman sped down the road in her car. She hadn&#x2019;t noticed the line of cars waiting for the light in front of her. And she never saw the motorcycle at the end of that line. She hit Delp at full speed. He was launched over three cars and landed on the fourth one with such force that he broke his back, multiple ribs, and his hips. He punctured his lung, and broke several teeth and his nose. His injuries were so catastrophic that he died right there at the intersection. Paramedics managed to revive him and then rushed him to the hospital. There he flatlined again and was revived once more. Doctors gave him twelve pints of blood. It poured through him.<br> <br>Delp&#x2019;s blood pressure was so low that he couldn&#x2019;t take any painkillers for a torturous week while his doctors waited until he was strong enough to undergo surgery. The pain was overwhelming. &#x201c;I was in so much pain. I told God, &#x2018;If this is all it is, please take me now,&#x2019; &#x201d; he says.<br> <br>Butch and Cindy Davis were among the close friends who gathered in the waiting room with Delp&#x2019;s wife, Debbie. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t think he was going to make it,&#x201d; says Davis. &#x201c;We stayed in the hospital and held a vigil.&#x201d;<br> <br>Davis and her husband met the Delps at a square dance thirty years before the accident. The couples quickly became close friends, vacationing together in their motorhomes. The Delps would stay up until two or three in the morning talking about their lives and planning new trips. They had plenty of time for whatever pursuit they could dream up. Delp had worked as a welder for twenty-seven years. He invested in real estate and retired in his forties. Now he and his wife were living comfortably off their investments. &#x201c;All I did was play,&#x201d; says Delp. &#x201c;I had a lot of time to go jet-skiing, ride motorcycles, go four-wheeling. We used to go dancing three or four nights a week. We camped and traveled all over the U.S.&#x201d; In the summers they went scalloping and waterskiing with Davis and her husband. They took cruises together with their children and grandchildren. Delp&#x2019;s parents had died when they were young and so he felt like he needed to experience as much as he could while he had the chance, says Cindy Davis. &#x201c;We called him Lying Luther because you never knew what he was going to say next; he was a big kidder,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>Delp had been so active, so physical&#x2014;always the first to slide under the camper to fix something&#x2014;that Cindy couldn&#x2019;t imagine how he could live after such a catastrophic accident. &#x201c;After such a trauma to his body, I didn&#x2019;t think that he wanted to pull through it,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>But Delp did survive. In the beginning he couldn&#x2019;t even sit up on his own. He lost movement and feeling in his legs and had little control over his torso. He developed bedsores. One on his backside grew so large and deep that Debbie could just about see through to the bone. She tried to keep things positive. &#x201c;When I&#x2019;d clean it and drain it, he&#x2019;d ask, &#x2018;How does it look? Does it look any better?&#x2019; and I&#x2019;d tell him, &#x2018;Yeah, a little bit. A little bit,&#x2019; &#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to discourage him. If he saw it, he would have completely given up on life. I really believe that and so I didn&#x2019;t tell him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Delp developed repeated infections. &#x201c;Sometimes his fever would be so bad that he&#x2019;d be shaking and I&#x2019;d go over there and put blankets on him and lay on him and try to keep him warm,&#x201d; says Debbie. Pressure sores continued to plague him. Psychologically he wasn&#x2019;t doing much better. He was angry with the world, with the woman who had put him in the hospital. &#x201c;I was real mad about it,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;She should have been watching where she was going and then I&#x2019;d still be riding my motorcycle.&#x201d;<br> <br>Like many people in this situation, Delp thought that he would walk again. When a year passed and he was still in a chair, it was another blow. &#x201c;In my mind I thought it was only temporary,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Debbie bought a van and put a lift in it and I got mad. Nobody could have ever told me that it was going to be permanent. I figured a couple of weeks and I&#x2019;d start walking. I thought, We can always get rid of the van.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Delp was not going to walk again. &#x201c;After I got out of the hospital, I realized that I&#x2019;m not going to get any better. What am I going to do? Am I just going to lay here and eat and watch TV?&#x201d;<br> <br>Delp is a big man, over six feet tall, broad-shouldered and barrel-chested, with close-cropped gray hair and a goatee. He loved traveling, getting outdoors, being active. And now he hated being in a wheelchair. Even more, he hated being seen in a wheelchair. After the accident, he avoided most of his old friends, a reminder of the outgoing, energetic life that he once had. He wouldn&#x2019;t even eat in a restaurant. Instead of going in, he&#x2019;d wait in the van while Debbie picked up takeout. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to be around somebody or see somebody that knew me and have them see me in a chair,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;That was a real hard thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that is where most people would expect Delp&#x2019;s story to end, with him stuck in a wheelchair, miserable, angry, depressed, stewing over all that had been so violently taken from him. Whatever life he could build after his accident would surely not match up to the able-bodied one that he had lost: his happy and healthy retirement with nothing to do but accumulate motorized toys, travel with his wife, and indulge in the pursuits that he enjoyed. He had lost a lot, and he had every right to be upset about it. Perhaps Delp would be left with lingering post-traumatic stress symptoms such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, or even full-blown post-traumatic stress disorder. For decades nearly all of the psychological research into trauma and recovery focused on the debilitating problems that people like Delp can face&#x2014;anger, guilt, hypervigilance, emotional numbness, flashbacks, even suicidal impulses that can last for years. Trauma survivors like Delp suffer through psychological pain every bit as terrible and challenging as the physical pain they must face. And that is the story that everyone is the most familiar with.<br> <br>But something different happened with Delp. Despite his depression and bitterness, he continued to work at his rehabilitation, exercising and lifting weights. One evening while Delp was working out, one of the staff members at Brooks Rehabilitation, where Delp did his physical therapy, encouraged Debbie to take her husband bowling&#x2014;it was a program sponsored by Brooks just for patients like Delp. Debbie brought it up, but Delp had no interest. Going out in public in his chair and trying something new, challenging, and likely awkward was a perfect combination of everything he had been avoiding since his accident. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t want to go,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;So I got him dressed and got him in his chair and he&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;Well, I&#x2019;m not going out.&#x2019; And I&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;That&#x2019;s fine,&#x2019; and I&#x2019;d just humor him and get him out.&#x201d; Once in the van, Delp agreed to go in, but just to watch. Then he rolled into the bowling alley and saw two dozen people bowling, talking, laughing, and having a good time. Most of them were in wheelchairs. Debbie got him a bowling ball and wheeled him next to a man with no arms who pushed his ball with a stick held up to his chin. The person on the other side of Delp had no hands. With little choice, Delp wheeled himself up to the line across the end of the lane, picked up the ball from his lap, and rolled it toward the pins. He started to talk to the people around him. He bowled some more. He stayed all evening.<br> <br>In the van on the way home, he started laughing. When Debbie asked what was so funny, he told her, &#x201c;You know, the reason I didn&#x2019;t want to come here was that I didn&#x2019;t want to be around a bunch of handicapped people,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Somehow I didn&#x2019;t realize that I was going to be one of them.&#x201d; That realization changed Delp. He had just found his community. The programs at Brooks and the people he met there would change his perspective on his life, and his own understanding of what he had to offer the world. &#x201c;I feel normal because I can help these people. I have the use of my hands. Some people can&#x2019;t feed themselves,&#x201d; says Delp. &#x201c;I think that helped me get out of the depression more than anything else.&#x201d;<br> <br>Delp began volunteering at both the hospital and the rehabilitation center. He started talking to new spinal cord injury patients about what to expect, how the injury would change their lives, even how to manage basic things like bodily functions that would become complicated. Sometimes he&#x2019;s on the phone until two o&#x2019;clock in the morning with friends who are wheelchair-bound. He began giving talks to college students to recruit interns for Brooks from a nearby university. &#x201c;Before I got hurt, I would never have gotten up in front of a bunch of people and talked. Now I look forward to it,&#x201d; says Delp. &#x201c;To go up to someone&#x2019;s hospital room, I never would have done stuff like that. I hated going to the hospital. I don&#x2019;t feel sorry for myself anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>Davis has marveled at the changes in her old friend. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not the same person that we knew,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s found a new way of life, of wanting to help others who are less fortunate than him.&#x201d; She says that before, he was outgoing, a fun and active person, but never the center of attention. He would have never considered getting up in front of people to discuss serious topics; he just wasn&#x2019;t confident that he had anything to offer others. His identity was the fun-loving, active, outgoing guy who just soaked up life. But that has all changed. Delp isn&#x2019;t happy in the same way that he used to be. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a different type of fulfillment that he&#x2019;s getting now,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Materialistic things have gone away and now he is giving of himself; the true love, the true happiness that he is making others feel is where he is coming from.&#x201d;<br> <br>Delp leads a full and meaningful life. He participates in several activities a day, everything from archery and skeet shooting to horseback riding or playing pool. He visits with patients, and helps to keep people motivated and engaged in the rehab center. He encourages people to get out to gatherings like the bowling night, and even gives some of them rides when they need it. He also lifts weights and swims to keep himself in shape so he can be as active as possible. &#x201c;My life changed that day,&#x201d; Delp said of the accident. &#x201c;I had a good life then, but I have a great life now.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>How could such a horrific accident with permanent, life-altering consequences transform a good life into a profoundly better and more meaningful one? Based on the conventional wisdom about trauma, Delp should have been left broken by his experience. But instead it transformed him. He left behind a happy life brimming with leisure and fun for a new life. Now he uses his time to help others. He finds meaning in his experiences and deeper value in his friendships. His life is different; he is different. He&#x2019;s a person that he could never have imagined the day before he was hit by that car.<br> <br>It is only in the last thirty or so years that a handful of psychologists even began asking how this could be possible, how trauma could change a person so deeply. How could it upend everything someone knew about himself and force him to build his life and sense of self anew? How could someone come out the other side of such a terrible event better, wiser, and more fulfilled? Oddly enough, the ones who first delved into this topic, who gave the phenomenon a name, started out by looking at something else entirely.<br> <br>One winter day in the early 1980s, two psychology professors from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence Calhoun, drove to Atlanta, Georgia, for a conference. Calhoun had been a tenured professor for some time and Tedeschi was going to receive tenure soon. And with that promotion would come a certain amount of freedom. The door was open for each of them to pursue research projects that were a little more unorthodox, ones that they just found interesting.<br> <br>Calhoun is wiry and energetic. He has a bounce to his voice and an earnest, almost boyish enthusiasm about him. For most of his career he had studied how people respond to adversity in one form or another; his work included helping people overcome various life crises. It was something that had always interested him. &#x201c;I was never interested in long-term psychotherapy,&#x201d; says Calhoun. &#x201c;I wanted short-term solutions; I wanted to work with people who were not psychotic, with whom I could make a difference and I could see that difference right away.&#x201d; About the time that Tedeschi got tenure, Calhoun&#x2019;s research partner left and he was looking for someone new to work with.<br> <br>Tedeschi is a sober counterpoint to Calhoun&#x2019;s animated personality. He&#x2019;s thoughtful and soft-spoken with a neatly trimmed moustache and a full head of graying hair. He fits just about anyone&#x2019;s preconceived notion of a psychologist. It&#x2019;s easy to imagine him saying in an even and unbiased tone, &#x201c;So how does that make you feel?&#x201d; This slightly odd pair got along well and, more important, they had similar interests. Tedeschi was also looking for a new focus in his work, something not centered on pathologies like depression or anxiety. Over the course of the four-hour drive, they began talking about the possibility of working together and what they might study. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be really interesting to talk to old people and just ask them, &#x2018;What have you learned about life that is useful, that you&#x2019;d like to pass on to others?&#x2019; &#x201d; Calhoun remembers one of them saying. It wasn&#x2019;t long before they started doing just that.<br> <br>They began their research by speaking to a group of widows. They didn&#x2019;t have elaborate questionnaires or psychological scales or models. They just asked open-ended questions and listened to what their subjects had to say. The women, who were between about fifty and eighty years old, mourned the loss of their husbands. Many of them cried nightly. Calhoun still remembers one woman who said she would wake in the middle of the night thinking she had just heard her husband put his key in the door. Then she would realize that he was gone and she&#x2019;d cry all over again. But, at the same time, they told the researchers that their husbands&#x2019; deaths pushed them to discover how strong they could be. Some got together with friends more often, others grew much closer to their children. Some who had never driven a car got a driver&#x2019;s license and gained a new independence.<br> <br>Next Tedeschi and Calhoun began to speak with people who had been disabled through an accident or illness. One woman they met had become an advocate for disabled rights and saw her disability as an opportunity to find a new focus and to help others. Another person they met was a former musician and drug abuser who had been paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident. They were surprised by his attitude.<br> <br>&#x201c;He was not saying, &#x2018;It shattered me; I&#x2019;m depressed and a shell of my former self,&#x2019; &#x201d; Calhoun says. Quite the opposite. While the musician was in the hospital, his doctor suggested he speak to some of the other patients who had been paralyz...</p><h2>WordGirl: Coalition of Malice: Coalition of Malice</h2><p>Only a superhero like WordGirl, endowed with power punches and dictionary strength, can put word-wrenching scoundrels back in their place!<br><br>Disguised as mild-mannered 5th grader Becky Botsford, WordGirl arrived on planet Earth when she and her monkey sidekick, Captain Huggy Face, crashed their spaceship.

The author incorporates the personal stories of parents who endured criticism for making their children sick, only to find themselves vindicated when the biological origins of these conditions were identified. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>You have to wonder if there's anyone left out there who dares call themselves a Freudian. Little is being written in defense of Freud and his legacy while the critiques, ever more confident and ever more damning, continue to fall from the presses like heavy Vienna snow. <i>Madness on the Couch</i> is one of the best.<p> Dolnick begins with a useful retread of the case against Freud himself, but his main argument is against a cherished principle of the master's followers. Freud always stuck to the idea that he was treating the psychological problems of the sane, but in the 1950s and 1960s, a much more grandiose idea emerged in psychiatric circles, the notion that "the talking cure" could sponge away madness itself.</p><p> One of the problems with this ambitious proposal was its vagueness. "Madness" could mean anything, including such different conditions as schizophrenia, autism, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. As Dolnick shows, analysts of various kinds had just two things in common: a systematic inability to do any good for patients with any of these conditions and a vast blindness, if not outright dishonesty, about that failure.</p><p> Like other critics of Freud's legacy, Dolnick is convinced that Freud-inspired analysis is guilty of doing its patients, and their families, great harm--by "explaining," for example, autism in terms of parental neglect. The section in <i>Madness on the Couch</i> on autism is especially good, concluding its discussion of all the things autism isn't (<i>pace</i> the wild and largely evidence-free surmises of therapists) with a balanced discussion of just how big a puzzle it still is.</p><p> Dolnick sometimes has an irritatingly sarcastic and melodramatic tone; a shame--the material he has assembled speaks strongly for itself. <i>--Richard Farr</i></p>Edward Dolnick, a contributing editor of <i>Health</i> magazine, is the former chief science writer for <i>The Boston Globe.</i> His articles have also appeared in <i>The Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times Magazine,</i> and many other publications.

It deserves a far better fate. Logbook is the fascinating chronicle, in diary form, of a voyage of one of the last Yankee whaleships in the twilight days of sail. More than that, it is an adventure story, a travelogue, a naturalist&#39;s notebook and a charming love story all rolled into one - written, it must be added, by a man whose profession is not writing, although he ha written scientific works. Robert Cushman Murphy is a naturalist - one of the world&#39;s great authorities on birds. During one of these expeditions Murphy begins to detail the life, sounds, sights, adversities, struggles, adventure, and survival of the whalers on the whaleship Daisy. Daisy herself, being an out of date vessel, takes on a life of her own. Combined with touching notes penned to his recent bride this book offers something for everyone.</p><p></p><h2>El Guero : A True Adventure Story</h2><p>The son of a respected judge, El Guero--&#34;The Blond One&#34;--never suspects that his comfortable life will change when the president is deposed by General Diaz in 1876. But his father&#39;s loyalty to the old government sends the family into exile almost overnight. El Guero and his family set off first to Acapulco and then by sea to the wild, bandit-infested territory of Baja, California.</p><p>Grade 4-7-- A fictional depiction of Mexican Judge Cayetano Trevino--an uncorruptible and highly respected jurist who was banished by Mexican dictator General Diaz in 1876 to the then unsettled, bandit-ridden territory in Northern Mexico known as Baja California. Narrated by the judge's son, El Guero, the story follows his family as they are uprooted from a comfortable life in Mexico City and forced into a frontier environment. In this back country, the judge establishes a modest shelter for his family and sets up a court, while El Guero (who is the author's father-in-law) makes friends with local Indian children. However, tragedy soon strikes: a younger sister dies of diphtheria, and outlaws eventually take control of the area (which is now Ensenada) and imprison the judge. The remainder of the story deals with El Guero and his friends' attempts to rescue his father and rid the area of bandits. The narrative lacks the elegant simplicity of I, Juan de Pareja (Farrar, 1965). Instead, it is stiff and emotionless, and inexplicably avoids dramatizing the inherently exciting parts of this story. In less than a page, for example, de Trevino dispenses with the defeat of the bandits and the freeing of Judge Trevino. The well-drawn charcoal art accompanying the story highlights the plot action, but it fails to overcome the lethargy and colorlessness of El Guero's disappointing narrative of this interesting slice of Mexican history. --Jack Forman, Mesa College Library, San Diego<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.In Spanish, El Guero means "the Blond One," and it just happens to be the nickname of Newbery Medalist (for I, Juan de Pareja ) Trevino's father-in-law. From his eventful childhood she has drawn the material for this riveting adventure, a story that chronicles the life of the Trevino family during the stormy political years prior to the Mexican Revolution. In 1876, Guero's father, a judge loyal to the recently deposed president, is exiled by the new dictator to a place called Ensenada. During the treacherous journey north to this dismal spot, the family is beset by numerous hardships, but their resourcefulness sees them safely through. When the judge is wrongfully imprisoned in the outpost town, it is up to Guero to make the long and dangerous trek south to alert the Mexican army and save his father. Trevino writes with authority and dignity, and her prose is lucid and powerful. The time, the place and the people all become vivid under her sure hand. It's an outstanding piece of work by a master of historical fiction.

Dazed and shaken, they emerged from the plane bloodied and injured as gunfire rained down around them. As of that moment they were prisoners of the FARC, a Colombian terrorist and Marxist rebel organization. In an instant they had become American captives in Colombia's volatile and ongoing conflict, which has lasted for almost fifty years.</p><p>In <em>Out of Captivity</em>, Gonsalves, Stansell, and Howes recount for the first time their amazing tale of survival, friendship, and, ultimately, rescue, tracing their five and a half years as hostages of the FARC. Their story takes you inside one of the world's most notorious terrorist organizations, going behind enemy lines with vivid and haunting imagery. Their words conjure a reality that few people have ever encountered&#x2014;from sleeping on beds literally carved out of the jungle to escaping Colombian military air strikes under the cover of darkness to being bound with steel chains by their captors. Describing backbreaking starvation marches and forced isolation, the authors chronicle their confrontations and interactions with the FARC guerrilla soldiers&#x2014;a motley crew of brainwashed, idealistic teenagers and seasoned vet-erans who've been around long enough to realize that the only way out of the FARC is in a body bag.</p><p>Though the physical punishments their bodies endured were unrelenting, the psychological battles they waged were the ultimate test of their resolve. With candid detail, Gonsalves, Stansell, and Howes relate the perilous mental struggles they each experienced, as they grappled with feelings of guilt, fear, and anxiety for the families and lives they'd left behind. Exposing the transformative power of captivity, they show how they turned these fears into strengths, using their memories and their families, their pasts and their futures, to motivate them in their quest for survival. </p><p>Despite the odds and the conditions, despite the chains and the silence, and despite the often tense relationships they experienced with their fellow Colombian hostages, they had one another, forging a bond that allowed them to cope with the horrific conditions of their confinement. This brotherhood enabled them to persevere through the worst that the FARC threw at them while always reminding them of their ultimate goal: freedom.</p><p>A harrowing account of one of the longest civilian hostage crises in United States history, <em>Out of Captivity</em> is a remarkable and compelling exploration of how far three Americans were willing to go as they fought to stay alive for themselves, their families, and one another.</p></p><p><p>Marc Gonsalves is a former member of the United States Air Force who worked as a civilian military contractor for four years before the crash. He has a daughter, Destiney, and two stepsons, Cody and Joey. He lives in Connecticut.</p></p><h2>Vanished Library</h2><p>First English edition with corrected translation.

He lives in the English countryside.Grade 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;This is a quirky story in which an old woman who lives alone at the edge of a dark, scary wood is protected by her pet frog. The creature easily handles any danger by swallowing each potential evildoer whole. The first villain to meet his fate is Greedy Goblin, followed by Smelly Troll, and finally Giant Hungry Ogre. As each bad guy nears Mrs. Collywobbles's house, he recites a rhyme themed around his distinct characteristics. "Nickerty-noo, nickerty-noo,/if I get a chance,/I'll steal from you," sings Greedy Goblin. The tale ends with a wicked twist. The narration and illustrations are joined tightly together. The text describes the scene in the pictures, pointing out specific things to notice. "Look! There is little Mrs. Collywobbles, hiding in her bathroom." The pen-and-ink and Macintosh artwork statically captures the "action" and creatively portrays each character. As he gobbles each villain, the frog sits passively with the feet, tail, and clothes of his victim hanging out of his mouth. Bright, flat colors contrast sharply against the white background. Stylized flowers and leaves give the pictures a 1960s look. The odd deadpan humor will not appeal to every child, but older readers and literature students will appreciate the irony of this almost fairy tale.&#x2014;<i>Carolyn Janssen, Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Studying the predictable things people do as they age is the ultimate tool for understanding trends. For instance, Dent can tell a client exactly when people will spend the most on potato chips. And he can explain why our economy has risen and fallen with the peak spending of generations, and why we now face a growing demographic cliff with the accelerating retirement of the Baby Boomers around the world. Dent predicted the impact of the Boomers hitting their highest growth in spending in the 1990s, when most economists saw the United States declining. And he anticipated the decline of Japan in the 1990s, when economists were proclaiming it would overtake the U.S. economy. But now, Dent argues, the fundam</p><p><b>HARRY S.

The wash is the most fundamental, most variable, and most characteristic technique in watercolor. Garcia believes that it's not difficult to master, and in this book he makes us believe it as well. He begins with the four basic washes: flat, graduated, wet-into-wet, and streaked. Further demonstrations combine washes and create textures (such as rocks, clouds, and sand). Garcia is particularly good at teaching advanced techniques using salt, a palette knife, sponges, spattering, and lifting.

While working as a marriage counselor for more than 30 years, he identified five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. In a friendly, often humorous style, he unpacks each one. Some husbands or wives may crave focused attention; another needs regular praise. Gifts are highly important to one spouse, while another sees fixing a leaky faucet, ironing a shirt, or cooking a meal as filling their "love tank." Some partners might find physical touch makes them feel valued: holding hands, giving back rubs, and sexual contact. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice. <p> How do you discover your spouse&#x2019;s &#x2013; and your own &#x2013; love language? Chapman&#x2019;s short questionnaires are one of several ways to find out. Throughout the book, he also includes application questions that can be answered more extensively in the beautifully detailed companion leather journal (an exclusive Amazon.com set). Each section of the journal corresponds with a chapter from the book, offering opportunities for deeper reflection on your marriage. </p><p> Although some readers may find choosing to love a spouse that they no longer even like &#x2013;hoping the feelings of affection will follow later&#x2013; a difficult concept to swallow, Chapman promises that the results will be worth the effort.

The volume comes complete with Dr. Golan&#39;s essay &#34;Performing Bach: Dotted Rhythms and Trills in the Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin,&#34; which also includes scholarly discussions of vibrato, fingerings, bowing styles, and ritardandos in Baroque music.

He claimed this was because it was the only part of the Third World whose two principal languages, Spanish and Portuguese, were within his reach. But he was also, of course, attracted by the potential for social revolution in Latin America. After the triumph of Fidel Castro in Cuba in January 1959, and even more after the defeat of the American attempt to overthrow him at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961, 'there was not an intellectual in Europe or the USA', he wrote, 'who was not under the spell of Latin America, a continent apparently bubbling with the lava of social revolutions'. The Third World 'brought the hope of revolution back to the First in the 1960s'. The two great international inspirations were Cuba and Vietnam, 'triumphs not only of revolution, but of Davids against Goliaths, of the weak against the all-powerful'.</p><p>Eric Hobsbawm was a Fellow of the British Academy and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Before retirement he taught at Birkbeck College, University of London, and after retirement at the New School for Social Research in New York. Previous books include AGE OF EXTREMES, THE AGE OF REVOLUTION and THE AGE OF EMPIRE.

Today, thanks to an extraordinary breakthrough, these inscribed remains are revealing a history lost to humanity for a millennium. An informed account of one of the most exciting adventures of our age. Illustrated.</p><p>Michael D. Coe is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University. His books include The Maya, Mexico, Breaking the Maya Code, Angkor and the Khmer Civilization, and&nbsp;Reading the Maya Glyphs. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.The decipherment of the Maya script was, Coe states, "one of the most exciting intellectual adventures of our age, on a par with the exploration of space and the discovery of the genetic code." He presents the story eloquently and in detail, with many illustrations of the mysterious Maya inscriptions and the people who tried to decipher them. Most of the credit, he says, goes to the late Yuri V. Knorosov of the Russian Institute of Ethnography, but many others participated. They did not always agree, and some of them went up blind alleys. Coe--emeritus professor of anthropology at Yale University--vividly describes the battles, missteps and successes. What is now established, he writes, is that "the Maya writing system is a mix of logograms and syllabic signs; with the latter, they could and often did write words purely phonetically." <p> Coe concludes with a swipe at "dirt archaeologists" who believe the decipherment of Maya writing "is not worthy of notice." According to them, he asserts, "the Maya inscriptions are 'epiphenomenal,' a ten-penny word meaning that Maya writing is only of marginal application since it is secondary to those more primary institutions--economy and society--so well studied by the dirt archaeologists." Coe sees that attitude as "sour grapes" and ascribes it to "the inability or unwillingness of anthropologically trained archaeologists to admit that they are dealing with the remains of real people, who once lived and spoke."</p></p><h2>50 Paintings You Should Know</h2><p>Spanning seven centuries, this selection of fifty iconic paintings offers readers a crash course in art history while presenting gorgeous colour reproductions that are a pleasure to contemplate.

Speaking of such works, anthropologist Claude L�vi-Strauss remarked that "all miniatures seem to have an intrinsic aesthetic quality."

Author John Mack explores the talismanic, religious, or magical properties with which miniatures are often imbued. Considering a wide range of objects--from Mughal miniature paintings, ancient Egyptian amulets, Ashanti gold weights, and Aztec jade figures to Hindu temple carts, English prints and drawings, classical Greek jewelry, maps, mosaics, models, and magical gems--he examines the use of the miniature form in various cultural contexts. He also assesses the importance of scale and questions the definition of "miniature." How large or small can a miniature be? Is a map a miniaturization of a larger world? What is the point of an object that is almost too small to be seen by the human eye? From Gulliver to King Kong, classical art to surrealism, Aristotle to the Yoruba, <i>The Art of Small Things</i> shows us, in fine detail, the exquisite and the esoteric, the wondrous and the weird. </p></p><p>John Mack is Professor of World Art Studies at the University of East Anglia.For most, miniature art tends only to conjure up a culture's lonely eccentricities--toy trains, dusty runes, weekend hobbyists tweezing ships into bottles. But John Mack's absorbing new book, <i>The Art of Small Things</i>, argues persuasively that the miniature is society writ small: Squint hard at the world's knickknackery and find the cultures that produced it...For those determined to browse, nearly every page boasts gorgeous color plates, many of which are by necessity larger than the objects being photographed. But more than a catalog of tiny curiosities, <i>The Art of Small Things</i> is a study of how we relate to objects of all sizes, and of how the miniature strangely enables experiences of the vast or ephemeral....The pleasure of this encyclopedic book lies in the resonances Mr. Mack finds between his many historical anecdotes. Mr. Mack's roving, capacious sections are not organized within an academic thesis so much as they are arranged like a bouquet of flowers, in evocative rather than linear groupings. The book itself enacts a kind of miniaturization by surveying so many artifacts in one volume.<br> --Jeremy Axelrod (<i>New York Sun</i> 2008-01-09)<br><br>Mack draws from many cultures to meditate on the aesthetic and cultural values seemingly embodied in small works of art. His examples range from Aztec to Indian, English to Greek and cover many media. Beginning with a comparison of small works of art with the colossal, Mack discusses miniature portraits, maps, sculptures (usually of the human figure), talismans and fetishes, and the private nature of small pieces...The illustrations, frequently with details, are good; some are larger than life, providing a sense of the wonder such tiny things can evoke.<br> --Jack Perry Brown (<i>Library Journal</i> 2008-03-01)<br><br>This lavishly illustrated compendium of miniature art explores our fascination with "the outer limits of visual perception and technical precision." Mack delves into the materials and technologies involved in the production of tiny artifacts, and the daunting skills required. (The contemporary micro-miniaturist Willard Wigan, who mounts sculptures in the eye of a needle, moves his diamond-tipped tools only in the middle of a heartbeat.) The book brims with captivating detail: intricately carved Japanese netsuke, used to suspend small belongings from the belt of a kimono, were also made to feel pleasant in the hand; Elizabethan mini-portraits worn as jewelry afforded the "private pleasure" of ownership. But, Mack concludes, miniatures are finally so desirable because they resist total possession: "We are forever denied ultimate access to their interiority and the secrets they may contain."

From the author of the Buddies trilogy and a regular contributor to The New Yorker.</p><p>According to Mordden's (I've a Feeling We're Not in Kansas Anymore) sweeping panorama of gay life in the United States, "the history meter is ticking"?and what a resonant sound it makes throughout these masterfully crafted pages. Beginning in L.A. in 1949 and concluding at New York City's 1991 Gay Pride Parade (with interim stops in San Francisco, rural New Hampshire and small-town Minnesota), this singular work chronicles the emerging gay consciousness with trenchant humor, editorial observations tinged with a soupcon of cynicism and scenes of often devastating emotional impact. Mordden pulls no punches as he presents a compelling assortment of quirky characters (both male and female) who connect, disconnect and reconnect in a constantly affecting game of musical lives. Bitter and sweet, it's all here: the barely opened closets of the 1950s, the 1969 Stonewall riots, the growing prominence of San Francisco ("the great city of do-as-you-like") as a gay capital and, of course, the coming of AIDS. Evocative descriptions make appropriate, occasionally campy, references to pop culture , while comic and poignant passages commingle throughout the detail-packed narrative?frequently within the same paragraph. Stylistic variations, too, blend to create an astonishing scope; Mordden changes tenses, addresses the reader and often presents the same scene, Rashomon-like, from several points of view. His characters remain achingly real, yet they also perfectly typify their generation?and, what's more, evolve with the changing gay climate. If the book has a message, it might well be found in the observation of a New Hampshire man in 1990: "It's not that things change so much as that we see them different." Thanks to Mordden's stunning work, we can see a little more clearly now.

Caroline is the chatelaine of a magnificent home, hostess to her husband's wealthy friends and prospective clients, and the official "one-woman welcome wagon" for young, eager talent that her husband, Clay, imports to their corner of South Carolina to work for the family company -- a vastly successful land-developing conglomerate. <p> If Caro drinks a little too much for Clay's liking, he knows the reason why, and he takes comfort in the fact that she can escape to the island in the Lowcountry that her beloved Granddaddy left her. Wild and seemingly timeless, the island is a place of incomparable, breathtaking beauty -- and it is the one place where Caroline can lose herself and simply <em>forget</em>. Roaming the island is a band of wild ponies whose freedom and spirit have captivated Caro since she was a child. When she learns that her husband must either develop the island or lose the company that he spent his whole life building, she is devastated.

His work is regularly selected for the Society of Illustrators&#x2019;, annual Original Art exhibition, and his illustrations are now being collected by the Dubuque Museum of Art. He lives in a converted bank in Bernard, Iowa.Kindergarten-Grade 3 A dignified, somber retelling of the flood story. An introductory paragraph from Genesis sets the stage, but after that, words are minimal. Double-page spreads of cream and black etchings appear above one line of text or none at all. Liberties taken with the Bible narrative increase its appeal. For instance, the book notes that ``The family found time to rest only at dinner''; the accompanying picture shows an exhausted group sitting on upturned boxes at a plank table while monkeys scamper overhead. There is a primitive, barren quality to the world that Geisert depicts. Before the flood Noah and his family live in a cave-like dwelling carved out of black rock. Except for a goat who tries to eat laundry off the line, the animals are not cute or clever. Rather, they seem to be dumb beasts patiently waiting for release. The ark itself dominates most of the pages. Often the artist's angle of vision adds interest to the scene. Pages showing a certain section of the boat include parts of the decks directly above and below, conveying a sense of life chafing under restrictions. This version of the ark story may lack the immediate attraction of Hogrogian's (Knopf, 1986) or Fussenegger's (Lippincott, 1987), but because it forces readers to rethink a familiar tale, it merits a place on the shelves.

Early, C S A, Defender of the Lost Cause</h2><p>The life story of one of the Civil War&#39;s most combative, assertive, and controversial generals examines his role in the successes and failures of Robert E. Lee&#39;s Army of Northern Virginia.</p><p>In the spate of Civil War books that flood the market each year, it is a wonder that no one has produced a full-scale, modern biography of Early. Thanks to veteran journalist Osborne, we now have a well-written and balanced account of Early's life and career that will appeal to general readers and scholars alike. Osborne explains the source of Early's extraordinary ambition, describes his antebellum political career, including his antisecessionist vote in the 1861 Virginia convention, and traces his development throughout the war into the bitter and unreconstructed rebel he always remained. The bulk of the book consists of Osborne's careful campaign history, for Early fought with Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia until he received an independent command in 1864. All the controversies that surrounded Early--about Gettysburg, the raid on Washington, and Cedar Creek--are handled in a judicious manner. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the book is Early's postwar machinations to elevate Lee to secular sainthood and to create the myth of the Lost Cause. Osborne does justice to a fascinating life. For public and academic libraries.<br><i>- David B. Mattern, Univ. of Virginia, Charlottesville</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.This well-written, comprehensive biography comes as close as is perhaps possible to a sympathetic treatment of the controversial Confederate (1816-1894). While acknowledging Early's post-Civil War role in creating the mythology of the "lost cause," Time-Life Books editor Osborne focuses on his subject's military career. He depicts Early as an extremely competent brigade and division commander who proved only adequate at corps level and a failure as an independent commander in the Shenandoah Valley. Conceding that Union material superiority was so great by 1864 that no one was likely to have performed any more effectively than Early, Osborne stresses the general's egocentricity and bitter, sardonic personality, traits that increasingly sapped his confidence and diminished his capacity to work with both superiors and subordinates. Marred somewhat by an unconvincing conclusion--that Early's behavior was shaped by a "deep fear of his softer side"--this is nevertheless likely to remain the definitive study of "Old Jube." <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Against the Current</h2><p>The eminent British historian-philosopher writes of those thinkers--Machiavelli, Vico, Montesquieu, Herzen, and Hume--whose plurality, diversity, or antidogmatism he most admires</p><p><br> <p>'This is an exceptional volume by a remarkable intellectual.

In <i>Domesticity at War</i>, Beatriz Colomina shows how postwar American architecture adapted the techniques and materials that were developed for military applications to domestic use. Just as manufacturers were turning wartime industry to peacetime productivity&#x2015;going from missiles to washing machines&#x2015;American architects and cultural institutions were, in Buckminster Fuller's words, turning "weaponry into livingry."This new form of domesticity itself turned out to be a powerful weapon. Images of American domestic bliss&#x2015;suburban homes, manicured lawns, kitchen accessories&#x2015;went around the world as an effective propaganda campaign. Cold War anxieties were masked by endlessly repeated images of a picture-perfect domestic environment. Even the popular conception of the architect became domesticated, changing from that of an austere modernist to a plaid-shirt wearing homebody.</p><p>Colomina examines, with interlocking case studies and an army of images, the embattled and obsessive domesticity of postwar America. She reports on, among other things, MOMA's exhibition of a Dymaxion Deployment Unit (DDU), a corrugated steel house suitable for use as a bomb shelter, barracks, or housing; Charles and Ray Eames's vigorous domestic life and their idea of architecture as a flexible stage for the theatrical spectacle of everyday life; and the American lawn as patriotic site and inalienable right.Domesticity at War itself has a distinctive architecture.

He spent the last ten years of his life working on the AENEID, the Trojan hero who fled the burning ruins of Troy with his father Anchises on his back, to Latium, in Italy where he became, ultimately, the founder of Rome. The poem is modeled on Homer&#39;s epics in both its verse form (dactylic hexameters) and organization.

Hyde is a cowboy and rancher, rodeo rider and clown, photographer and author of 15 books on cowboying, fishing, and natural history. In the 180s, Dayton witnessed some of America&#39;s last wild mustangs being rounded up and sent to slaughter; it pulled at the old cowboy&#39;s heart strings, and he vowed to do something about it. In 188, he established The Black Hills Wild Horse Sanctuary near Hot Springs, Sough Dakota, an 11,000-acre ranch to protect wild horses. Long held sacred by the Cheyenne, Lakota, and other Native American tribes, the area is a place where visitors can view the Wild West as it was.Starred Review. At 13, Hyde ran away from home, hopping a train from Wisconsin to his uncle's ranch in Oregon. Like countless other American kids in the 1930s, he wanted to be a cowboy. Hyde became that, and much more: rodeo clown, <i>Life</i> photographer, WWII soldier, author, historian and driving force behind the campaign to save the country's few remaining herds of wild horses. It's a dramatic life story, and Hyde has a raconteur's gift for telling it well. He vividly describes his initiations into the trade of cowboy, enduring the ridicule of grizzled ranch hands with little patience for a gangly teenager. Hyde earns their respect by risking his life to herd cattle through a blizzard; he earns some more by breaking horses no one else is able to tame. After he fights the Nazis, he organizes a rodeo inside a Roman coliseum in liberated France. His adventures over the years are populated with a colorful collection of friends. Some are towering figures who embody the Old West, like the septuagenarian cowboy who thinks nothing of tracking, capturing and taming a wild mustang in a single afternoon. Others seem like characters from a saloon act, like the two drunks who, attempting to dig a grave with dynamite, accidentally blast the surrounding coffins above ground. One especially captivating personality is rodeo clown Slim Pickens, whose lopsided grin would eventually enliven films like <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> and <i>Blazing Saddles</i>. Hyde mourns these figures' passing along with the West he loved. As wistful as it is humorous, this salty memoir is also an elegy for a bygone era.

After a cow knocks over a pail of milk, Molly, a 17-year-old dairy maid, must go on trial for theftAa crime punishable by death in 1683 England. However, because she can read the Bible, the court spares her life and instead deports her to America as an indentured servant. McGill effectively portrays Molly's determination when her servitude ends and she stakes her legal claim to farmland: "That a lone woman should stake land was unheard of, but Molly's new neighbors saw the way she jutted out her chin." However, the narrative glosses over the evolution of Molly's relationship with Bannaky, an enslaved African she buys to help her work her land, as well as any social complications that may have arisen when she falls in love with Bannaky and later marries him. The abrupt conclusion conveniently introduces Benjamin Banneker and circles back to Molly's life-saving gift of literacy (she is shown teaching her grandson to read). A historical note fills in a few gaps in the story with some additional information about Molly Bannaky and Benjamin Banneker. Unfortunately, neither the note nor the story explains how the surname changed from Bannaky to Banneker. Soentpiet's watercolors span scenes of both public pageantry and private moments, but seem uncharacteristically stiff and undramatic. For example, the climactic spilt milk scene is left to readers' imagination. In addition, the illustrations of Molly are inconsistent; she looks almost like a different person from one spread to the next. Ages 4-8.

These cuisines may now be on the verge of extinction, however, because almost none of the Jewish communities in which they developed and thrived still exist. But they continue to be viable in Israel, where there are still cooks from the immigrant generations who know and love these dishes. Israel has become a living laboratory for this beloved and endangered Jewish food.<br> &nbsp;<br> The more than one hundred original, wide-ranging recipes in <i>Jewish Soul Food</i>&#x2014;from Kubaneh, a surprising Yemenite version of a brioche, to Ushpa-lau, a hearty Bukharan pilaf&#x2014;were chosen not by an editor or a chef but, rather, by what Janna Gur calls &#x201c;natural selection.&#x201d; These are the dishes that, though rooted in their original Diaspora provenance, have been embraced by Israelis and have become part of the country&#x2019;s culinary landscape. The premise of <i>Jewish Soul Food</i> is that the only way to preserve traditional cuisine for future generations is to cook it, and Janna Gur gives us recipes that continue to charm with their practicality, relevance, and deliciousness. Here are the best of the best: recipes from a fascinatingly diverse food culture that will give you a chance to enrich your own cooking repertoire and to preserve a valuable element of the Jewish heritage and of its collective soul.<br><br>(With full-color photographs throughout.)</p><p><b>JANNA GUR</b> was born and raised in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to Israel in 1974. She is the founder and chief editor of the leading Israeli food and wine magazine. She lives in Tel Aviv.<b>From the Introduction...</b><br><br>Wherever Jews settled in the Diaspora, they created cuisines. They had to. Naturally, they were influenced by the ingredients and cooking styles of the countries in which they lived, but their kitchens were also different from the kitchens of their neighbors. Kosher dietary laws precluded their using certain foods and combinations; even more important, these laws, which progressively became more strict and all-encompassing, imposed on them a degree of culinary isolation: Jews not only cooked and ate differently, they were not allowed to sample the nonkosher food of the Gentiles. A few years ago, I watched a television interview with a Yemenite Jew who had recently arrived in Israel. When he was asked whether his food tasted different from that of his Muslim neighbors, he looked puzzled: &#x201c;How would I know? I have never tried it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The concept of kashruth made Jewish food different. It also made it extremely significant: To a large extent Jews are defined (in their own eyes and in the eyes of the others) by what they eat and don&#x2019;t eat. The centrality of cooking in Jewish culture is especially evident on Shabbat and holidays. Shabbat poses an almost impossible challenge: The day on which even the poorest must eat a proper meal is also the day on which no fire can be lit and no manual work can be done. And the result: Across the globe, unique dishes were devised for Friday-night dinners and Shabbat lunches. Holiday cooking is where Jewish cuisines are at their most exuberant. At the core of almost every holiday, there is a festive, elaborate meal&#x2014;from the strictly regulated ceremonial menu served at a Passover Seder to the symbolic foods consumed at Rosh Hashanah. <br> &nbsp;<br> Last but not least, Jewish cuisines are unique because they reflect the histories of their respective communities. Many Eastern European Ashkenazi dishes preserve archaic influences from Alsace and even Italy; the cooking of Turkish and Bulgarian Jews bears similarities to that of their ancestors during the Golden Age in Spain; the cuisines of Iraqi Jews and Indian Jews have a lot in common because of close ties between these communities.<br> &nbsp;<br> #<br> &nbsp;<br> This world of culinary wisdom faced dramatic changes in the twentieth century as the vast majority of those scattered in the Jewish Diaspora ceased (or nearly ceased) to exist in their original provenances. Millions of Jews from all over the world immigrated to Israel, a tiny country with an ambition to reinvent itself as a nation. The culinary baggage Jewish repatriates brought with them was at first a burden rather than a legacy. In the early days of the Zionist movement, there was an overwhelming impulse to reject the Diaspora&#x2014;its customs, its language, its foods.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later on, as waves of immigrants flooded the country in the wake of World War II, the ideological rejection was replaced by something more poignant: children ashamed of the immigrant ways of their parents&#x2014;their language, their customs, their food. Be it an Ashkenazi boy embarrassed in front of his classmates because of his chopped liver sandwich or a Moroccan girl who wouldn&#x2019;t let her mother serve North African sweets at her birthday party. The parents, on the other hand, clung tenaciously to their culinary legacy as a way to preserve their identities&#x2014;to connect with their families, to remember their homes. <br> &nbsp;<br> Toward the end of the millennium, as the ethos of the melting pot gave way to more inclusive approaches to everything cultural, the foods of Jewish communities became again a source of pride and inspiration, even for a younger generation, certainly for Israeli chefs. Some cuisines did better than others: Balkan and North African food traditions that suit the local climate and ingredients so well are among the most beloved in modern-day Israel. Ashkenazi food, which in the eyes of the world is synonymous with &#x201c;Jewish cooking,&#x201d; is less popular, but recent years have brought a new interest in it, sparked by the trendiness of Jewish Ashkenazi cooking in North America, especially in New York.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today, more and more Israelis are aware of the importance of preserving their family cooking heritages. Self-published family cookbooks have become very common, and it is touching to see how much love and longing are invested in these modest publications. Still the big question looms: Can these cuisines, which are products of the unique circumstances of Jewish life in places like Iraq, Turkey, Yemen, Morocco, or Poland, really survive in their new home? Or to put it in simpler words: Who will cook this food in the next generation and who will eat it? Much of it is a labor-intensive, time-consuming, old-fashioned kind of cooking. Indeed, in most families it is the grandmother who still cooks the food from the old country. Her children, long since busy parents themselves, love it, but don&#x2019;t have time to cook it. As for the grandchildren, they probably have tasted it only at a few family occasions, and by the time they are old enough to care and get interested, the grandmother is gone, and when they ask the mother how to make something, she often doesn&#x2019;t know. &#x201c;I should have asked her for the recipe but never got around to it and now it is too late.&#x201d; You have no idea how often I have heard this! <br> &nbsp;<br> Gastronomy may seem to lend itself easily to preservation, especially in our digital age. But transcribing a recipe or even videoing it is not nearly enough. The only way to really preserve a culinary culture&#x2014;to keep it alive&#x2014;is to cook the food and make people want to eat it. It would be naive to assume that all the wealth of Jewish cooking can be kept alive in this way. Most of it eventually will be relegated to the folkloristic fringes of the culinary scene. But in the world of Jewish food, there are so many dishes that are delicious, exciting, and doable that they can survive relocation and gain a new lease on life in the modern kitchen.<br> &nbsp;<br> #<br> &nbsp;<br> It is with these thoughts that I approached the project that eventually became this book. The Jewish bookshelf is brimming with excellent works. Some of them are encyclopedic in their scope; others, dedicated to the cooking of a specific community, offer a captivating blend of recipes, folklore, and history. But this depth and scope can sometimes be overwhelming, especially to someone new in the field. I felt that what was missing was something more focused, edited, and therefore approachable; I decided to confine myself to about one hundred dishes from as many Jewish communities as possible&#x2014;a kind of greatest hits from our Jewish grandmothers.<br> &nbsp;<br> In selecting the dishes, I tried to crack the code of a winning dish&#x2014;what is it that makes us adopt and adapt a certain recipe and abandon another? Surely, there&#x2019;s the relative ease of preparation, and the availability of ingredients, but there&#x2019;s something else&#x2014;the &#x201c;soul&#x201d; of a dish, that elusive quality that makes us relish it and want to make it ours. To discover that soul was my goal, but I cannot really claim that it was just I who curated this selection.<br> &nbsp;<br> Israel today is a living laboratory of Jewish food, as our cooks, both professional and amateur, are exposed to a multitude of cuisines and dishes. Through a process of natural selection, some of them have been discovered and adopted by the whole society because of their deliciousness and practicality. In this respect, the real editors of this collection are anonymous Israelis who prepare these dishes in their kitchens or order them in restaurants, and in this way are keeping them alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was also very lucky: During the twenty-odd years of editing an Israeli food magazine, I learned from many great cooks around me and was able to compare different versions of the same dish. Many recipes in this book are indeed credited to specific cooks&#x2014;professional and amateur&#x2014;while others are the sum total of tips and techniques I picked up along the way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most recipes are authentic (often with little tweaks that make life easier), but here and there I was tempted to offer a creative take on a traditional dish: like Erez Komarovsky&#x2019;s Gondalach&#x2014;a charming fusion of Ashenazi kneidlach and Persian gondi dumplings; or Omer Miller&#x2019;s Exiles Cholent, which cleverly blends ingredients and techniques from several Shabbat casseroles with delicious results. <br> &nbsp;<br> It was important for me to show that these dishes feel perfectly at home in a modern kitchen (they certainly do in mine): The salads and snacks featured in the first chapter are great for parties and cookouts; Meatless Mains offers healthful and nutritious options for both weekday and special-occasion meals. The Shabbat chapter might lead you to rethink your weekend menu and invite friends for &#x201c;Sabich breakfast&#x201d; or serve them a visually stunning and easy-to-make Hamin Macaroni.<br> &nbsp;<br> As these recipes come from so many different cuisines, some of the ingredients might be a little hard to come by. Wherever possible, more readily available substitutes are suggested, but I do urge you to try to get the real stuff at least once&#x2014;the difference can be dramatic.<br> &nbsp;<br> To use a culinary metaphor, I would like to regard this selection as an appetizer&#x2014;a sampler that will encourage you to explore more dishes from various Jewish cuisines. If you enjoy Lakhoukh panfried bread, you might be tempted to look further afield and discover other distinctive breads from the Yemenite kitchen; while T&#x2019;bit&#x2014;an ingenious Iraqi Shabbat casserole&#x2014;could be a wonderful introduction to one of the most ancient and unique Jewish cuisines. I can also envision a different scenario&#x2014;your encountering a dish that you remember from your childhood and deciding, for the first time in your life, to make it in your own kitchen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Either way, every dish you cook from this book (or other Jewish cookbooks for that matter) is meaningful in a way that goes beyond its taste and your personal enjoyment. By cooking it and serving it to those you love, you help to keep it alive and pass it on to the next generation.</p><h2>Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse (Paperback) /anglais</h2><p>The Impressionists were among the first to portray gardens directly from life, focusing on their colour and form rather than using them as a background for historical, religious and literary themes. This book explores the symbiotic relationship that developed during the latter part of the nineteenth century and the first part of the twentieth between artists and gardens, focusing on Monet and the creation of his garden at Giverny. Beautifully illustrated with masterpieces by Monet, his fellow Impressionists and such painters as Bonnard, Sargent, Klee, Kandinsky, Klimt, Matisse and Nolde, Painting the Modern Garden traces the effects of artistic movements and social and political influences on the garden in modern art.</p><p><b>Monty Don</b> is a horticulturalist who has written widely on gardens and gardening.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Ann Dumas</b> is a curator at the Royal Academy of Arts.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Heather Lemonedes</b> is curator of drawings at the Cleveland Museum of Art.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>James Priest</b> is head gardener at Monet&#x2019;s garden at Giverny.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>William Robinson</b> is curator of modern European art at the Cleveland Museum.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Clare A.P.

The scene is New York's Central Park, but the rich natural history that emerges here--the loons, raccoons, woodpeckers, owls, and hundreds of visiting songbirds--will appeal to wildlife lovers everywhere. At its heart is the saga of the Fifth Avenue hawks, which begins as a love story and develops into a full-fledged mystery.<br><br>At the outset of our journey we meet the Regulars, a small band of nature lovers who devote themselves to the park and its wildlife. As they watch Pale Male, a remarkable young red-tailed hawk, woo and win his first mate, they are soon transformed into addicted hawk-watchers. From a bench at the park's model-boat pond they observe the hawks building a nest in an astonishing spot--a high ledge of a Fifth Avenue building three floors above Mary Tyler Moore's apartment and across the street from Woody Allen's.<br><br>The drama of the Fifth Avenue hawks--hunting, courting, mating, and striving against great odds to raise a family in their unprecedented nest site--is alternately hilarious and heartbreaking. <i>Red-Tails in Love</i> will delight and inspire readers for years to come.</p><p>The literature of bird watching is full of memoirs set in out-of-the-way, rural locales, but few are set in the heart of big cities such as New York, where <i>Wall Street Journal</i> ornithology columnist Marie Winn hangs her hat. In this delightful account, Winn tells of birding in Central Park with an unlikely band of fellow enthusiasts (including Mary Tyler Moore and Woody Allen). Among her objects of study were a pair of increasingly uncommon wood thrushes who set up their nest in the park's Ramble, treating city dwellers to their "penetrating, flutelike, heart-stoppingly beautiful song: Ee-oh-lee, ee-oh-loo-ee-lee, ee-lay-loo," and a pair of red-tail hawks who courted, mated, and produced offspring, thus quickening the spirits of Manhattanites. Both urbanites and those inclined to country matters will enjoy Winn's gracefully written story of observation and discovery."Red-Tails in Love is a witty, tender, and beguiling record of two striking Central Park-dwelling species--the red-tailed hawks on their Fifth Avenue stick nest, and the flock of binoculared 'Regulars' at their Hawk Bench. Seemingly written by someone who is part bird, the book is a lively interweaving of the family saga of Pale Male and his variously doomed mates with the tale of the Regulars' fidelity to their self-appointed roles as Nest Patrol, Feeding Squad, ombudspersons, and safety netters. Red-Tails in Love explains why some humans belong to the ardent, obsessed subspecies known as 'birdwatcher.'" <br>--Galway Kinnell <br> <br>"Marie Winn brings the eye of a superb nature writer to the human and avian life of Central Park, and the result is a delightful book that leaves the reader with a new respect for the sheer power of nature in the face of all odds to claim its rightful place in the city." <br>--Michael Pollan <br> <br>"Red-tailed hawks hovering above Fifth Avenue become the inspiration for daily inquiries into how one touches wildness in the heart of a city. Marie Winn gives us a book of reverie." <br>--Terry Tempest Williams <br> <br>"This book has a rare charm, beguiling the innocent reader who thinks it's about birdwatching into a wonderland of many levels. After reading it I walked across Central Park on a familiar route and saw New York City, in face the whole urban experience, with very different eyes and spirit." <br>--Robert MacNeil</p><h2>Different Dances</h2><p>This collection of Silverstein&#39;s startling, irreverent, and provocative cartoons satirizes the social absurdities and calamities of the adult world, covering the misalliances, misconceptions, and misdemeanors of contemporary life</p><p><p>a modern<br> ballet<br> where<br> lovers are ground<br> to hamburger<br> wives are turned into chairs<br> TV sets eat people<br> flowers grow from<br> children's heads<br> God is uncovered -- and<br> re-covered<br> and men are hung<br> by the instrument<br> of their desire</p><p>Startling, irreverent and provocative, the incomparable creator of poems and fables for children turns his eye and pen upon the social calamities and absurdities of the adult world.</p><p>Shel Silverstein 's incomparable career as a bestselling children's book author and illustrator began with <em>Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back</em>.

Amply illustrated with more than 50 beautiful color images, author Barbara Brackman's lively text situates quilts within the culture of the American West. In such a context, quilts become more than just bed coverings: they are cultural artifacts, revealing much about women's lives, their roles and their perceptions of the world.<br>Brackman also examines the ways in which the sewing machine changed women's aesthetic perceptions of the beauty of their work, and how that aesthetic has evolved to the present day.</p><p>ART</p><h2>God, Father and Creator, Vol. 1 (A Catechesis on the Creed)</h2><p>In this first of three volumes which deal with the Trinity, the Pope reflects on the mystery of God the Father. John Paul II presents the mystery of God in a fresh, modern persepctive that can meet the contemporary challenges of atheism and unbelief.</p><p></p><h2>The Family That Overtook Christ</h2><p>He was called the man of his age, the voice of his century. His influence towered above that of his contemporaries, and his sanctity moved God himself. Men flocked to him--some in wonder, others in curiosity, but all drawn by the magnetism of his spiritual gianthood. Bernard of Clairvaux--who or what fashioned him to be suitable for his role of counseling Popes, healing schisms, battling errors and filling the world with holy religious and profound spiritual doctrine? Undoubtedly, Bernard is the product of God&#39;s grace. But it is hard to say whether this grace is more evident in Bernard himself or in the extraordinary family in which God choose to situate this dynamic personality. This book is the fascinating account of a family that took seriously the challenge to follow Christ... and to overtake Him. With warmth and realism, Venerable Tescelin, Blesseds Alice, Guy, Gerard, Humbeline, Andrew, Bartholomew, Nivard and St. Bernard step off these pages with the engaging naturalness that atttacks imitation. Here is a book that makes centuries disappear, as each member of this unique family becomes an inspiration in our own quest of overtaking Christ.</p><p></p><h2>Owl Babies</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Born in Belfast, Martin Waddell was an aspiring football player for many years, before turning his hand to writing. He is now widely regarded as one of the greatest living children&#39;s writers, and has over 220 published titles to his name. He is perhaps best known for Owl Babies, illustrated by Patrick Benson and Farmer Duck, illustrated by Helen Oxenbury; as well as the 1989 Kurt Maschler Award-winning The Park in the Dark and the Little Bear series, both illustrated by Barbara Firth. In 2004, Martin received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for his lasting contribution to children&#39;s literature, the highest career recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children&#39;s books. He lives in Newcastle, County Durham.Lorelei King starts with an upbeat tone to portray three fluffy, enthusiastic baby owls who live in a cozy nest. Accompanying music complements the bubbly, energetic spirit of the opening. Then the owl babies wake to find their mother missing. King manages to give each baby an individual voice as they try to comfort each other but finally begin screeching with fear. The soundscape of soft owl hoots and quiet night noises contrasts with their crescendo. Just in time for the panicky owl babes and for young listeners who need relief, mother owl arrives, swooping in as King&#39;s comforting narration makes much of the happy reunion. There&#39;s also a quieter rendition, with a bell tone signaling page-turns, for beginning readers who need a bit of support. S.W. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English</h2><p>A complete translation of the Dead Sea scrolls, with introductory chapters describing the historical, cultural and religious background to the scrolls.</p><p>It's been 50 years since a Bedouin youth named Muhammed edh-Dhub went looking for a stray sheep and instead found the Dead Sea Scrolls. In the intervening decades, the scrolls have been enveloped in a storm of controversy and bitter conflict: the scholars entrusted with translating and editing the texts sat on many of them instead, creating suspicions that escalated to conspiracy theories about supposed cover-ups of sensitive, even damaging material. Geza Vermes, a former professor of Jewish studies at Oxford and a noted authority on the scrolls, marks the 50th anniversary of Muhammed edh-Dhub's find with his book <i>The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English</i>; the title, however, is misleading, for the collection of documents is by no means complete. <p> Vermes has left out the copies of Hebrew scriptures that are available elsewhere, instead focusing on the sectarian writings of the Essene community at Qumran and the intertestemental texts, and these are indeed complete translations. Vermes has also included an overview of five decades of research on the scrolls and a thumbnail sketch of the Qumran community's history and religion. For anyone interested in biblical history, <i>The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English</i> is a worthwhile read.</p>Geza Vermes is Professor Emeritus of Jewish Studies at Oxford University. He has been director of the Forum for Qumran Research at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies since 1991.</p><h2>Race, Nation, Class: Ambiguous Identities</h2><p>Forty years after the defeat of Nazism, and twenty years after the great wave of decolonization, how is it that racism remains a <i>growing</i> phenomenon? What are the special characteristics of contemporary racism? How can it be related to class divisions and to the contradictions of the nation-state? And how far, in turn, does racism today compel us to rethink the relationship between class struggles and nationalism?<br><br>This book attempts to answer these fundamental questions through a remarkable dialogue between the French philosopher Etienne Balibar and the American historian and sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein. Each brings to the debate the fruits of over two decades of analytical work, greatly inspired, respectively, by Louis Althusser and Fernand Braudel.<br><br>Both authors challenge the commonly held notion of racism as a continuation of, or throwback to, the xenophobias of past societies and communities. They analyse it instead as a social relation indissolubly tied to present social structures&#x2014;the nation-state, the division of labour, and the division between core and periphery&#x2014;which are themselves constantly being reconstructed. Despite their productive disagreements, Balibar and Wallerstein both emphasize the modernity of racism and the need to understand its relation to contemporary capitalism and class struggle. Above all, their dialogue reveals the forms of present and future social conflict, in a world where the crisis of the nation-state is accompanied by an alarming rise of nationalism and chauvinism.</p><p><b>�tienne Balibar</b> is a French Marxist philosopher and the most celebrated student of Louis Althusser.

The only uncertainty is whether or not we will rise to greet it. </p><p> </p><p> Alan Christoffersen&#x2019;s diary </p><p> </p><p>Several months after I was mugged, stabbed, and left unconscious along the shoulder of Washington&#x2019;s Highway 2, a friend asked me what being stabbed felt like. I told her it hurt.</p><p> </p><p>Really, how do you describe pain? Sometimes doctors ask us to rate our pain on a scale from one to ten, as if that number had some reliable meaning. In my opinion there needs to be a more objective rating system, something comparative; like, would you trade what you&#x2019;re feeling for a root canal or maybe half a childbirth?</p><p> </p><p>And with what would we compare emotional pain&#x2014;physical pain? Arguably, emotional pain is the greater of the two evils. Sometimes people will inflict physical pain on themselves to dull their emotional anguish. I understand. If I had the choice between being stabbed or losing my wife, McKale, again, the knife has the advantage&#x2014;because if the knife kills me, I stop hurting. If it doesn&#x2019;t kill me, the wound will heal. Either way the pain stops. But no matter what I do, my McKale is never coming back. And I can&#x2019;t imagine that the pain in my heart will ever go away.</p><p> </p><p>Still, there is hope&#x2014;not to forget McKale, nor even to understand why I had to lose her&#x2014;but to accept that I did and somehow go on. As a friend recently said to me, no matter what I do, McKale will always be a part of me. The question is, what part&#x2014;a spring of gratitude, or a fountain of bitterness? Someday I&#x2019;ll have to decide. Someday the sun will rise again. The only uncertainty is whether or not I will rise to greet it.</p><p> </p><p>In the meantime, what I hope for most is <i>hope</i>. Walking helps. I wish I were walking again right now. I think I&#x2019;d rather be anywhere right now than where I am.</p><p> </p><p>� 2011 Richard Paul Evans</p><p> </p><p> <b> <b>CHAPTER</b></b></p><p><b><b><i>One</i></b> </b> </p><p> Note </p><p> We plan our lives in long, unbroken stretches that intersect our dreams the way highways connect the city dots on a road map. But in the end we learn that life is lived in the side roads, alleys, and detours. </p><p> </p><p> Alan Christoffersen&#x2019;s diary </p><p> </p><p>My name is Alan Christoffersen and this is the second journal of my walk. I&#x2019;m writing from a hospital room in Spokane, Washington. I&#x2019;m not sure how you came to be holding my book&#x2014;truthfully, I don&#x2019;t even know if you are&#x2014;but if you&#x2019;re reading my story, welcome to my journey.</p><p> </p><p>You don&#x2019;t know much about me. I&#x2019;m a thirty-two-year-old former advertising executive, and sixteen days ago I walked away from my home in Bridle Trails, Seattle, leaving everything behind, which, frankly, wasn&#x2019;t much by the time I started my trek. I&#x2019;m walking to Key West, Florida&#x2014;that&#x2019;s about 3,500 miles, give or take a few steps.</p><p> </p><p>Before my life imploded, I was, as one of my clients put it, &#x201c;the poster child for the American dream&#x201d;&#x2014;a happily married, successful advertising executive with a gorgeous wife (McKale), a thriving advertising agency with a wall of awards and accolades, and a $2 million home with horse property and two luxury cars parked in the garage.</p><p> </p><p>Then the universe switched the tracks beneath me, and in just five weeks I lost it all. My slide began when McKale broke her neck in a horse-riding accident. Four weeks later she died of complications. While I was caring for her in the hospital, my clients were stolen by my partner, Kyle Craig, and my financial world collapsed, leading to the foreclosure of my home and repossession of my cars.</p><p> </p><p>With my wife, business, house, and cars gone, I packed up what I needed to survive and started my walk to Key West.</p><p> </p><p>I&#x2019;m not trying to set any records or wind up in any newspapers. I&#x2019;m certainly not the first to cross the continent by foot; I&#x2019;m at least a century too late for that. In fact, the first attempt was made more than two hundred years ago by a man named John Ledyard, who planned to walk across Siberia, ride a Russian fur-trade vessel across the ocean to (what is now) Alaska, and then walk the rest of the way to Washington, D.C., where Thomas Jefferson would warmly greet him. Such are the plans of men. Ledyard only made it as far as Siberia, where Russian Empress, Catherine the Great, had him arrested and sent to Poland.</p><p> </p><p>Since then, no less than a few thousand pioneers, prospectors, and mountainmen have crossed the continent without air-cushioned walking shoes, paved roads, or, unbelievably, a single McDonald&#x2019;s.</p><p> </p><p>Even in our day there is a sizable list of countrycrossers, including an eighty-nine-year-old woman who walked from California to Washington, D.C., and a New Jersey man who <i>ran</i> from New Brunswick to San Francisco in exactly sixty days.</p><p> </p><p>Nearly all of these travelers carried causes with them, from political reform to childhood obesity. Not me. The only torch I&#x2019;m carrying is the one for my wife.</p><p> </p><p>You might guess that my destination was chosen for its balmy weather, blinding white beaches, and topaz blue waters, but you&#x2019;d be wrong: Key West was simply the furthest point on the map from where I started.</p><p> </p><p>I should add the disclaimer that Key West is my <i>intended</i> destination. It is my experience that journeys rarely take us where we think we&#x2019;re going. As Steinbeck wrote, &#x201c;we do not take a trip; a trip takes us.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s a difference between reading a map and traveling the road&#x2014;as distinct as the disparity between reading a menu and eating a meal. So it is with life. As the saying goes, &#x201c;Life is what happens to us while we&#x2019;re planning something else.&#x201d; That is true. Even my detours had detours.</p><p> </p><p>My most recent detour has left me in the emergency room of Sacred Heart Medical Center with a concussion and three knife wounds to my belly after being jumped by a gang three miles outside Spokane. That&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;re joining me.</p><p> </p><p>For those of you who have been following my walk since my first step (or before), I warned you that my story wouldn&#x2019;t be easy. I suppose that&#x2019;s no surprise; no one&#x2019;s story is easy. No one goes through life without pain&#x2014;of this I&#x2019;m certain. The price for joy is sadness. The price for having is loss. You can moan and whine about this and play the victim&#x2014;many do&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s just the way it is. I&#x2019;ve had a lot of time to think about this. That&#x2019;s one of the benefits of walking.</p><p> </p><p>I also warned you in my first journal that you might not believe or be ready for all I have to share with you. This book is no different. No matter&#x2014;accept or dismiss what you want to believe.</p><p> </p><p>Since I began my walk, I&#x2019;ve traveled only 318 miles, less than ten percent of the distance to Key West. But already there have been profound experiences; I&#x2019;ve met people along the way I believe I was meant to meet and I&#x2019;m certain there are more to come.</p><p> </p><p>This is a story of contrasts&#x2014;about living and dying, hope and despair, pain and healing, and the tenuous, thin places between both extremes where most of us reside.</p><p> </p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure whether I&#x2019;m walking away from my past or toward a future&#x2014;time and miles will tell and I have plenty of both. As the poet Robert Frost said, I have &#x201c;miles to go before I sleep.&#x201d;</p><p> </p><p>I&#x2019;m happy to share with you what I learn. Welcome to my walk.</p><p> </p><p>� 2011 Richard Paul Evans</p><p> </p><p> <b> <b>CHAPTER</b></b></p><p><b><b><i>Two</i></b> </b> </p><p> Note </p><p> I&#x2019;ve gone from a schedule of hours and minutes to not being able to tell you what day of the month it is. </p><p> </p><p> Alan Christoffersen&#x2019;s diary </p><p> </p><p>My second night in the hospital was rough. I was wet and hot with fever and somewhere in the night I started coughing. Each expulsion felt like another blade plunging into my stomach. The nurse checked my bandages, then told me not to cough, which wasn&#x2019;t at all helpful. In spite of the medications they gave me to help me sleep, for most of the night I just lay there, lonely and aching. I wanted McKale more than life. Definitely more than life. Of course, if she were with me, I wouldn&#x2019;t be in this mess in the first place. Exhaustion finally overcame me and I fell asleep around 4 or 5 A.M.</p><p> </p><p>The next day I woke to a young nurse walking around my bed looking at monitors and writing on a clipboard. Since I&#x2019;d been admitted to the hospital, a bevy of nurses and doctors had been swarming around me in my delirium, flashing in and out of my consciousness like dancers in a music video. But I didn&#x2019;t remember any of them. This was the first nurse I was cognizant of. She was small, petite, and barely the height of a floor lamp.

He focused with effort, looking for the joyous faces of his fellow colonists.<br>Not there. Nor was Beth.<br>Instead, the worried frowns of Mayra and Abduss Wickramsingh made him groggily anxious as they worked over him. Their faces swam away, came back, drifting above like clouds as the cold began to recede. He was <i>tired.</i> His bones ached with it. After decades of sleep&nbsp;<i>... </i><br>Hands massaged his rubbery legs. Lungs wheezed. His heart labored, thumping in his ears. His throat rasped with a sour wind. He was finally starting to shiver. Sluggish sleep fell away like a mummy&#x2019;s moldy shroud.<br><i>Think.</i> The Wickramsinghs were paired by ability, he recalled in a gray fog, self-sufficient and solely responsible for the three years of their watch. Mayra piloted, and Abduss was the engineer. They were fairly far down the queue, maybe twenty-seven watches.... How far along were they? It hurt to figure.<br>They turned him on his side to work on his stiff muscles. The massaging sent lancing pain, and he let out a muffled scream. They ignored that. At least he could see better. Against the hard ceramic glare, he could see that no others of <i>SunSeeker</i>&#x2019;s 436 passengers in cold sleep were being revived. A capsule was running its program, though, so someone was coming out behind him. The bay was empty. Carboceramic tiles were clean, looking like new.<br>As a scientist, he was not slated to come out until the infrastructure staff was up and running at Scorpii 3, the balmy world that everybody called Glory, that no eye had ever seen.<br>So they were maybe eighty years into the voyage. Not enough to be near Glory. Something was wrong.<br>Mayra&#x2019;s lips moved, glistening in the hard light, but he heard nothing. They worked on his neural connections and&#x2014;<i>pop!</i>&#x2014;he could hear. The dull rumble hammered at him. Interstellar surf.<br>&#x201c;Okay? Okay?&#x201d; Mayra said anxiously, mouth tight, her eyes intent. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br>He coughed, hacked. Once his throat was clear of milky fluid, his first words were, &#x201c;Cliff&nbsp;... Kammash. But&nbsp;... Why me? I&#x2019;m bio. Is Beth still cold?&#x201d;<br>They didn&#x2019;t answer at once, but each looked at the other.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk,&#x201d; Mayra said softly, a smile flickering.<br>Definitely trouble. He had known the Wickramsinghs slightly in training, remembered them as reserved and disciplined, just what a cryo passenger would wish in a caretaker watch team.<br>And they were good. They got his creaky body up off the slab, kind hands helping, his muscles screaming. Then into a gown, detaching the IVs. Up, creaking onto his feet. He swayed, the room reeled, he sat down. Try again. Better&nbsp;... a step. First in eighty years, feet like bricks. They helped him shuffle to a table. He sat. Minutes crawled by as he felt air swoosh in and out of his lungs. He studied this phenomenon carefully, as though it were a miracle. As perhaps it was.<br>Food appeared. Coffee: caffeine, yes, lovely caffeine. Nobody spoke. Next course, soup. It tasted like nectar, the essence of life. Then they told him, as he eagerly slurped down a big bowl of fragrant veggie mix grown aboard. Halfway through his third bowl, he became vaguely aware that they were talking about an astrophysical observation that required his interpretation.<br>&#x201c;What? Mayra, Astro is <i>you,</i>&#x201d; he shot back. &#x201c;Every pilot has to be.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We need a different viewpoint,&#x201d; Mayra said, her dark eyes wary. &#x201c;We do not want to bias your views by explaining more now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We are reviving the captain, too,&#x201d; Abduss said.<br>He blinked, startled. &#x201c;Redwing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s that important.&#x201d; Abduss was unreadable. &#x201c;He will awaken in another day, his capsule says.&#x201d;<br>Cliff felt a chill that was not thermal. Stores of food, water, oxygen couldn&#x2019;t be recycled forever. That was the point in riding semi-frozen: They would reach Glory with enough stores to survive until they could replace what was lost.<br>&#x201c;Four of us. Waking too many people would run us short,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br>Again, the Wickramsinghs looked at each other and did not answer.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>As soon as he could walk steadily, they showed him the viewing screens, and for a long moment he could not speak.<br>The spectacle was striking, both for what was familiar and what was not. <i>SunSeeker</i> was forty light-years from Earth, and yet he could identify many of the constellations he had known as a child in Brazil. Their familiar faces swam among a bright swarm of lesser lights, twisted here and there. On the scale of the galaxy, light-years did not count for much.<br>He immediately looked for their destination. A star not much different from Sol, Glory&#x2019;s primary should be a white point dead ahead. It was there, reassuringly bright, though still five light-years away. Perhaps its brilliance was enhanced by <i>SunSeeker</i>&#x2019;s velocity? No, that was a small effect. More probably, brightened by his own longing to see, to breathe, to touch an Earthlike world, named Glory out of pure hope before any human eye had seen it. Pixels and spectra didn&#x2019;t do the job.<br>Other stars brimmed in the rosy night lit by <i>SunSeeker</i>&#x2019;s bow shock. The ramscoop&#x2019;s plowing through the interstellar gas and ionized hydrogen was an unending rainbow light show, filmy incandescent streamers curving around them as they plunged into the infinite night. Beyond that prow wash lay the spectrally shifted universe. Some of the glimmering stars were intriguing, constellations rearranged&#x2014;but nothing compared to the nearby red sun.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d; Cliff asked.<br>Abduss nodded. &#x201c;It is a problem, but there is another, larger. We have been wrestling with this more difficult issue, but that can wait for the captain.&#x201d;<br><i>Can&#x2019;t these people ever say anything straight?</i> He made himself say deliberately, &#x201c;Okay, tell me what&#x2019;s the big deal about this star?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We are overtaking it. When we came on watch, the star was not visible. There was a mild recombination source nearby, rather odd.&#x201d; Switching to another channel, Abduss pointed out a diffuse ivory plume behind the dark patch.<br>Cliff frowned. &#x201c;How long is it?&#x201d;<br>Abduss said, &#x201c;About three astronomical units. This is a signature of hydrogen recombining, after it has been ionized. This linear feature seems to be a jet, cooling off and then turning back into atoms. That&#x2019;s the emission I made this map from, you see?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Um.&#x201d; Cliff wrinkled his nose, trying to think like an Astro type. &#x201c;A jet from a star. It didn&#x2019;t jump out at you?&#x201d;<br>Abduss tightened his mouth but otherwise did not move. &#x201c;At first we did not even <i>see</i> the star.&#x201d;<br><i>Uh-oh...,</i> Cliff thought. Best to shut up, yes.<br>&#x201c;We had much to measure. The jet did not attract much attention, as it seemed unimportant. Yet now we can see it to be related to the star&#x2014;which suddenly appeared.&#x201d;<br>Cliff nodded, smiled, tried to defuse the man&#x2019;s irritation. &#x201c;Perfectly understandable. Our problems are inside the ship, not outside. So&nbsp;... the star popped into view because it came around the rim of this&nbsp;... thing.&#x201d;<br>Mayra murmured, &#x201c;We became alarmed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nobody noticed the star before? Earlier watches?&#x201d;<br>Abduss blinked slowly. &#x201c;We could not see it.&#x201d;<br>Cliff shrugged. In moderate close-up, the dwarf showed as a disk: it must be close. It was perched at the lip of a much larger arc of light. An ordinary star, little and reddish. He raised an eyebrow at Mayra.<br>&#x201c;The spectral class is F9,&#x201d; Mayra added helpfully. &#x201c;Most likely the plasma plume means that this star must have been recently active. Early stars often display this.&#x201d; Under magnification, the expelled matter looked to Cliff like a thin nebula, dim and old.<br>&#x201c;But we don&#x2019;t know it&#x2019;s a young star,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;No, stars of this class have very long lifetimes.&#x201d;<br>Cliff had never been much concerned with the fate of failed stars as they erupted and faltered. Spectacular, sure, easy to sell to contract monitors&#x2014;but biology demands a stable abode. Still, he immediately guessed that this veil was a remnant of an earlier era in the star&#x2019;s life, when it was blowing off shells of hot gas. A good guess, anyway&#x2014;but of course, not his field. These details of stellar evolution had never interested him very much, since they had little to do with his specialty, the evolution of higher life-forms on worlds similar to Earth. A largely abstract pursuit until the Alpha Centauri discoveries of a simple but strange ecology there. That was what drew him to Glory; Beth was an accidental benefit.<br>So he shrugged. &#x201c;Gas from a small star.

These superb illustrations--many rarely or never before published--include &#34;Roses&#34;, which in 1991 commanded the highest price ever paid to date for a photograph at auction. 148 duotone photos.</p><p>Apprentice to and lover of photographer Edward Weston in Mexico during the 1920s, Italian-born activist Modotti developed at that time a not widely known but consequential body of camera work of her own: portrait, still-life, architectural and documentary photos, the latter applied in large part to further the cause of world communism. Here, in a monumental feat of biographical research and picture assemblage for a current exhibition, art historian Lowe apparently tells all that can be known about this revolutionary artist?her friendships with populist painters Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros et al.; her succession of lovers, one of whom was assassinated; her own imprisonment and deportation; her work for the Soviet International Red Aid in Berlin, Moscow and combat zones of the Spanish Civil War. As seen here, taken as a whole, Modotti's oeuvre seems to mock in equal measure Weston's dictum of art for art's sake and the conventional view that propaganda cannot be art. Her pictures of campesinos at work and on parade are as arresting as her twin lilies seen plain. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Planet Earth (Usborne Beginners, Level 2)</h2><p>Describes Earth as a planet, covering its geologic features, continents, and such natural processes as erosion and the water cycle.</p><p>Leonie Pratt is the author of <i>China, Big Book of Science Things to Make and Do</i>, and <i>Planet Earth: Level 2</i>.&#39;No Key Stage 1 classroom should be without the whole set&#39; - The Bookseller; &#39;Good quality non-fiction for this age group is a real boon and the Usborne Beginners is an excellent series.

Good guys: The People, cussed hardscrabble liberal Vermonters; direct democracy; town meetings; and the "George Washington of Vermont ... the boozing, brawling, blasphemous giant," Ethan Allen. The Bad Guys: elites; technocrats; centralism; almost all state-wide standards; many environmentalists; the education lobby that has killed small schools; and all "systems manipulators" who, by statute and bureaucracy, exercise a feudal power over the Green mountains of Vermont. The People yes! say the authors Frank Bryan and John McClaughry. Though they excuse themselves from liberal and conservative labels, they are populists throughout, from the book's dedication to Ethan Allen, to the back cover flap showing Bryan in his John Deere cap and McClaughry in a Farm Bureau chapeau. What Brookings Institute fellow, what Heritage Foundation pundit would be pictured in a feed cap? Bryan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Vermont, has been gathering data on town meetings (that forum of pure democracy) for the last ten years; McClaughry was a senior policy advisor in the Reagan White House and, more importantly, has been a townmeeting moderator for twenty-two years. Both have ridden the roller coaster of public discussion many times and still they say let the people with the mud on their boots decide everything. If Bryan and McClaughry have their way, Vermont, as we know it, will cease to exist. This book is an earnest, detailed blueprint to transform Vermont, shrinking the state government by three-quarters and returning power to the towns and a new entity, the shire (an area somewhat smaller than a county). Vermont would, in the Swiss manner, become a federation of autonomous cantons, here not working with Swiss precision but rather a "healthy chaos" of cantankerous Yankee republics. Back to the towns and shires go welfare, education, the lower courts, roads, and much taxation. In a reversal of the usual order, all unspecified powers are reserved by the town and shire, not the state. The state looks after civil rights and the environment (but no prissy ordinances against leaving a junk car or three in the dooryard); runs a supreme court; and administers all sundry financial matters. This shrunken state government is Ereed up to lobby the Federal government and play a world role (through die Office of Global Involvement). "Our reform abandons the way of government currently in favor: education by mega-standards, welfare by mailbox, police protection by radio, and health care by stranger," say the authors. If the roads and schools vary from shire to shire, then that is the price of democracy. The bulk of the book is taken up with the intricate details of this new goverturient, including everything from creating heraldry and pageants for the shire to a ten-point program for agriculture and a timetable for a Vermont constitutional convention to set their plan in motion. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>Amarna Sunset: Nefertiti, Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and the Egyptian Counter-Reformation</h2><p>This new study, drawing on the latest research, tells the story of the decline and fall of the pharaoh Akhenaten&#x2019;s religious revolution in the fourteenth century bc. Beginning at the regime&#x2019;s high-point in his Year 12, it traces the subsequent collapse that saw the deaths of many of the king&#x2019;s loved ones, his attempts to guarantee the revolution through co-rulers, and the last frenzied assault on the god Amun. <br>The book then outlines the events of the subsequent five decades that saw the extinction of the royal line, an attempt to place a foreigner on Egypt&#x2019;s throne, and the accession of three army officers in turn. Among its conclusions are that the mother of Tutankhamun was none other than Nefertiti, and that the queen was joint-pharaoh in turn with both her husband Akhenaten and her son. As such, she was herself instrumental in beginning the return to orthodoxy, undoing her erstwhile husband&#x2019;s life-work before her own mysterious disappearance.</p><p>Aidan Dodson is a research fellow in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Bristol, UK, where he teaches Egyptology.

In <i>The Great Book of Couscous</i> Marks presents the history and culinary brilliance of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia; the region of North Africa also know as the Maghreb. Couscous is a common cooking ingredient, along spices--particularly cinnamon, cumin, coriander and paprika, in all these countries. Each of these areas was also originally populated by the Berbers, occupied by the Ottoman Turks and the Arabs, then colonized by the French. These cultures heavily influenced the local cooking, with some differences in each.<p> Moroccan food is the most complex and sophisticated, Marks explains. Dishes may blend half a dozen spices, along with dried fruit and salt preserved lemons or olives. Tunisian food is relatively simple and hot, though many cooks will still find it amply robust and intriguing. Algerian food, Marks claims, is the most creative, as well as the most marked by French influences. Armchair chefs will enjoy the colorful descriptions of the markets, visits with home cooks, and experiences in restaurants. The recipes for the many tagines or stews, roasted chickens, and other dishes are easy to follow. Their ingredients are mostly available at supermarkets. The inclusion of Jewish dishes from the Maghreb make this a particularly interesting book for many people not familiar with the garlic-rich Moroccan Chickpea Stew or Algerian Merguez Juive, a sausage made with lamb or beef, cumin, coriander, and fiery chile powder. Though it takes some work to prepare the clear, precisely written recipes Marks provides, the aromatic, succulent results are worth the effort. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>Copeland Marks, a contributor to such magazines as Gourmet, Food &amp; Wine, and Bon Appetit, is the acclaimed author of The Great Book of Couscous and Sephardic Cooking (all Donald I.

Pursued by both the Nazis and Spanish Francoists, Vigoleis and Beatrice embark on a series of the most unpredictable and surreal adventures in order to survive. Low on money, the couple seeks shelter in a brothel for the military, serves as tour guides to groups of German tourists, and befriends such literary figures Robert Graves and Harry Kessler, as well as the local community of smugglers, aristocrats, and exiled German Jews. Vigoleis with his inventor hat on even creates a self-inflating brassiere. Then the Spanish Civil War erupts, presenting new challenges to their escape plan. Throughout, Vigoleis is an irresistibly engaging narrator; by turns amusing, erudite, naughty, and always utterly entertaining. Drawing comparisons to Don Quixote and The Man Without Qualities, The Island of Second Sight is a novel of astonishing and singular richness of language and purpose; the story is picaresque, the voice ironic, the detail often hilarious, yet it is a work of profound seriousness, with an anti-war, anti-fascist, humanistic attitude at its core. With a style ranging from the philosophical to the grotesque, the colloquial to the arcane, The Island of Second Sight is a literary tour de force.</p><p>Albert Vigoleis Thelen (1903-1989) was a German writer and translator.*Starred Review* On this balcony, Cervantes wrote Don Quixote. With a bit of mischievously mendacious literary history, Vigo&#x2014;the narrator-protagonist of this brilliant novel&#x2014;gulls credulous German tourists. Based on the five difficult years that author Thelen and his wife, Beatrice, spent on Mallorca in the 1930s, this novel delivers the gritty texture of lived experience. But as Vigo recounts his (mis)adventures, readers realize that, like Cervantes&#x2019; visionary knight, Vigo sees things others do not. While living in a dirty Mallorcan bordello, Vigo transforms himself into a chivalric champion defending his beloved against threatening dragon-rats. Like Quixote assaulting windmill-giants, Vigo declares war against his Nazified German homeland&#x2014;by buying an American typewriter rather than a German one. But Vigo&#x2019;s quixotic crusade takes on a dangerously real edge when he uses his typewriter to denounce the f�hrer. Yet, like Quixote escaping from a perilously enchanted castle, Vigo and his wife escape from an island descending into the maelstrom of civil war. To be sure, this modern Quixote wields a sardonic sense of humor quite lacking in his literary predecessor. But that humor finally becomes Vigo&#x2019;s own imaginative weapon against an all-too-ugly reality. Readers will thank a gifted translator for finally making this masterpiece&#x2014;acclaimed by Thomas Mann&#x2014;available to English speakers. --Bryce Christensen</p><h2>Life after television (The Larger agenda series)</h2><p>Television has long been identified as a dead hand on culture; but George Gilder suggests here that this centralized, authoritarian institution is also a dying technology and that the telecomputer - a powerful interactive system that will affect all aspects of life, from education to business to leisure time - will replace it. America is presently at the forefront of telecomputer development, but government restrictions - such as those that limit the wide use of fibre-optic technology - may hinder the American companies in the vanguard. Gilder&#39;s optimistic message is that the United States has only to unleash its industrial resources to command the &#34;telefuture&#34;, in which new technology will overthrow the stultifying influence of mass media and renew the power of individuals.</p><p>In his visionary new book George Gilder brilliantly and persuasively outlines the sweeping new developments in computer and fiber optic technology that spell certain death to traditional television and telephony. In their places, he argues, will emerge a new paradigm in which people-to-people communications give way to links among computers to be found in every home and office. The rise of the telecomputer (or &#34;teleputer&#34;) will utterly transform the way we do business, educate our children, and spend our leisure time, and will imperil such large, centralized, top-down organizations as cable networks, phone companies, government bureaucracies, and multinational corporations. The stultifying influence of the mass media will give way to the power of the individual and the spread of democracy - and all through a technology in which America leads the world.

There have been various interpretations of Archilochus&#39; fragment; Isaiah Berlin has simply used it, without implying anything about the true meaning of the words, to outline a fundamental distinction that exists in mankind, between those who are fascinated by the infinite variety of things (foxes) and those who relate everything to a central all-embracing system (hedgehogs). When applied to Tolstoy, the image illuminates a paradox of his philosophy of history, and shows why he was frequently misunderstood by his contemporaries and critics. Tolstoy was by nature a fox, but he believed in being a hedgehog.</p><p>Sir Isaiah Berlin OM spent the whole of his professional life at Oxford, as a Fellow of All Souls College, a Fellow of New College, Chichele Professor of Social and Political theory and first President of Wolfson College.

When a routine magazine assignment led her to realize that her stereotype of Wiccans as eccentric spiritual outsiders was embarrassingly misinformed, her curiosity compelled her to understand the Wiccan mystique. With the support of a journalism fellowship, Sanders spent a year interviewing neo-Pagans and witches and found that the lure of this emerging spirituality was not the occult, but rather a search for meaning in an increasingly fragmented and materialistic culture. <br><br>With keen observation, challenging insight, and compassionate critique, Sanders produces a lively narrative about what she experienced and discovered during her travels: Halloween rituals in Salem, anti-globalization protests in New York, and the contrasts between what seekers find in neo-Paganism that they perceive as lacking in Christian tradition. In <i>Wicca&#x2019;s Charm,</i> Sanders explains the powerful attraction of an increasingly mainstream spirituality that celebrates the wonder of creation and the life-giving energy of women while also exploring why Christian churches often fail to engage these seekers, but how they can learn to tap into the deep roots of Christianity to nourish the hunger of so many who seek a holistic and authentic worship experience.</p><p><b>Catherine Edwards Sanders</b> is a journalist with experience in radio, television, and print journals such as<i> The Weekly Standard, The Washington Times, Insight, World Magazine, </i>and <i>Coastal Living</i>.

Sanders was a journalist on assignment when she was forced to examine her own stereotypical views of Wicca; subsequently, she secured a journalism fellowship to spend a year learning about Wicca and what makes it so appealing to its practitioners; an objective view of the tradition results. Discussion questions at the end of the book correspond to each of the chapters. The result is a good, basic overview of the origins and theories of the religion as well as plenty of firsthand accounts from current and former practitioners of Wicca..<b>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal </i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Wicca&#x2019;s Charm</i> is one of those books that charms and beguiles you even as it informs you.

In the year 3000, aliens have invaded Earth and taken over England. Now they are starting on the United States.</p><p><i>Camelot 3000</i> will probably catch your eye for two reasons: It is illustrated by the great Brian Bolland (<i>The Killing Joke</i>), and it involves King Arthur in the Year 3000, when bloodthirsty reptilian aliens invade Earth seeking world domination. Upon fleeing said scaly alien invaders, young protagonist Tom stumbles into a cave and uncovers King Arthur's tomb, which contains a surprisingly spry King Arthur. Understandably bewildered by all that lies before him, Arthur makes short work of a few little green men and teams up with Tom to cleave a path to salvation. <p> In his introduction, writer Mike W. Barr admits to overwriting the early third or so of this story--every character's motive is plainly spelled out in thought bubbles and hefty dialogue balloons. Yet, therein lies the fun of <i>Camelot 3000</i>: It&#x2019;s written with all the excitement of a kid conning his babysitter into staying up past his bedtime. Early on, when a television crew catches wind of Arthur, an eager journalist pushes a microphone in front of the Son of Pendragon, and the response is classic midnight movie madness: "Why would I converse with one who sticks a sausage in my face? Away with you!" And then Arthur ceremoniously pulls the sword from the stone.</p><p> The twelve-issue series began in the early 1980s, when comics were first sold exclusively through direct trade comic shops rather than convenience store spinners, and as a result, it could skirt the comics code and flirt with adult themes (watch for a transgendered knight, several risqu� love scenes, and Morgan LeFay's surprisingly grotesque secret). Eventually, Barr settles down and characters grow less verbose, and Bolland's clean and rich artwork is given greater breathing room. Nowadays, Bolland usually does his own inking as well as pencils, but for <i>Camelot 3000</i>'s deadlines, DC brought aboard talented inkers Terry Austin, Dick Giordano, and Bruce Patterson to finesse. There isn&#x2019;t much subtlety here, but just as Arthur is resurrected, so too are his knights and loves, including Lancelot and Guinevere. Even in the 31st Century, history repeats itself, and Arthur is aware of his eventual betrayal from the start. He also takes down a spaceship with a swipe from Excalibur.</p><p> This new "Deluxe Edition" is slightly oversized and contains character designs, sketches, unused covers, and more (especially impressive is the fine packaging underneath the eye-catching dust jacket). <i>Camelot 3000</i> is a late-night space opera that makes it all too easy to stay up past bedtime. <i>--Alex Carr</i></p>Mike W.

It was manned by slaves on oars, and in its middle, as if to emphasize her importance, sat its principal passenger, Barbara Montgeoffry, widow to an earl, and therefore a countess: the Countess Devane. She was young to be widowed already, only one-and-twenty, like the century. She sat small, exquisite yet fragile-looking in her widow&#x2019;s weeds&#x2014;clothes solidly black as the manners of the time demanded.<br><br>Other passengers included the Deputy Governor of the colony and the Countess&#x2019;s servants, a young French maid and a page boy, a slave himself. Two pug dogs, a cow, and six willow baskets with chickens inside were wedged in and around trunks, wooden boxes, barrels, and furniture wrapped in oilcloth.<br><br>The river was wide, the sky blue-white. Birds chirped in trees that stood like ancient sentinels on the banks. For some time now, from the east, from the direction of Williamsburg&#x2014;the principal town and capital of the colony&#x2014;clouds had been gathering, rolling over and into each other. At this bend in the river, there were no houses, only fields and trees, a forest of trees, huge trees, primeval trees, as old possibly as the land itself, certainly older than the colony, which had existed upon the shores of this river and three others to the north only since 1607.<br><br>&#x201c;Governor Spotswood, how much farther?&#x201d; asked Barbara impatiently.<br><br>She was the reason the Governor had taken time from his duties to man a galley up the James River.<br><br>&#x201c;We are not half the way yet. Are you unwell again? Shall we land? Perry&#x2019;s Grove is an hour or so ahead,&#x201d; Sir Alexander Spotswood answered. An older man, in his fifties, he was deputy governor of the colony. As he spoke, a sudden wind came up to shake the fringe on his buckskin coat and pull at the sides of his wig, a full, formal, dark wig, in the style that the late king of France, Louis XIV, had made fashionable. It was parted in the middle to hang down majestically around the face.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite well, just impatient to reach First Curle.&#x201d;<br><br>She&#x2019;d come to Virginia from England to look over her grandmother&#x2019;s plantation, but there had been a delay of a week while she recovered from a fever. Her arrival was completely unexpected, as was her fever; to the Governor, it was as if a shimmering butterfly had landed unexpectedly in his colony, a butterfly with the most impressive of ancestors. The Countess&#x2019;s grandfather Richard Saylor had been a renowned and beloved general in the long war with France that had taken up the Governor&#x2019;s young manhood&#x2014;and that of so many others&#x2014;in the 1680s and 1690s and into the beginning of this century. Richard Saylor&#x2019;s military exploits had earned him a dukedom. The Governor had served under him once upon a time.<br><br>Is there going to be rain? thought the Governor, staring at the sky. The clouds were suddenly closer; he&#x2019;d swear they had moved at least a mile since the last time he checked them. He looked at the shore, estimating where they were, where to take shelter should it begin to rain.<br><br>He looked over to the young Countess, his fragile black butterfly. He did not imagine her responding kindly to a storm of rain, though she had displayed nothing but beautiful manners so far, beautiful manners that matched a beautiful face the precise shape of a heart, a fair and sweet face.<br><br>The Lionheart&#x2019;s granddaughter, thought the Governor, for a moment taking time to wonder at the world, at its smallness. Richard Saylor had been called the Lionheart by his soldiers. To imagine that he took the Lionheart&#x2019;s granddaughter to a river plantation that belonged to the family. What honor. And what obligation. He glanced once more at the sky. The clouds were above them now. It was going to rain.<br><br>Do I land or keep going? he thought. Will she be more angry to be wet or to be delayed? She&#x2019;s been ill. She&#x2019;s in mourning. She is not used to our roughness&#x2014;only look at the entourage she&#x2019;s brought with her: a French lady&#x2019;s maid, a page boy, and two pug dogs. Her dogs, her servants, were the talk of Williamsburg. I&#x2019;d better seek shelter and see that she is protected, he thought.<br><br>Large, determined drops of rain splattered the oilcloth covering the table and chairs, the barrels and trunks. The waters of the river stirred underneath the galley, as if something large and menacing had turned over. Wind rattled the ropes and iron rings on the sail, and the galley rocked back and forth in spite of the steady, powerful rhythm of the rowers. The cow, wedged among boxes and barrels, stretched out her neck toward land and lowed.<br><br>At that moment, the wind struck like a fist, and a basket of chickens fell over, the chickens in them escaping, clucking, squawking, flying into everyone. The dogs began to bark, and the young page boy, Hyacinthe, leaped up to lean dangerously over the side after a chicken.<br><br>&#x201c;Hyacinthe! Sit down! Never mind the chickens! What is happening, Governor Spotswood? Th�r�se! For God&#x2019;s sake, shut those dogs up!&#x201d;<br><br>It was the fragile black butterfly, Barbara, who spoke, yanking her page boy back down on the plank seat beside her as she did so.<br><br>Spotswood did not answer, for he was maneuvering his way through the cargo to get to the center mast and let down the sail, which was whipping in its rigging like something desperate to be free. A squawking chicken flew straight into his face. It screamed. But not any louder than he did.<br><br>&#x201c;Damnation and blast and confounded hands of Jesus Christ! A storm, that is what is happening, Lady Devane. A large one!&#x201d;<br><br>He sent the chicken whirling overboard. Over them, the sky was rolling ominous, cresting clouds. The day was, in a moment, dark, as if evening had come. Barbara watched yet another chicken cluck and cry and run amok until it flew into the water and disappeared, squawking and screaming to the last, under water that was now foaming and cresting dangerously.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; said Hyacinthe in French, &#x201c;your grandmother the Duchess&#x2014;&#x201d; He did not finish. But then, he did not have to. Barbara&#x2019;s grandmother, the Duchess of Tamworth, Richard Saylor&#x2019;s fierce and indomitable widow, was quite proud of her chickens and cows, wanting them on her plantation in Virginia. She had been specific in her instruction.<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; Barbara said, also in French. &#x201c;The chickens have no importance as long as we are safe.&#x201d;<br><br>She raised her face to the rain, to the dark sky, exhilarated rather than frightened by this sudden wildness coming up from nothing around her. During the week she had lain impatiently in the best bed in the best bedchamber in the Governor&#x2019;s house in Williamsburg, ill with an ague, or fever, which was one of the hazards of coming to this colony, they had warned her of these sudden storms. They&#x2019;d described ferocious lightning and deafening thunder as part of the storms.<br><br>Carters, Burwells, Lees, Pages, Fitzhughs, Ludwells. They were among the biggest landowners, the Governor had told her, the gentry of this colony, and she was wise enough in her fever to smile upon them as they buzzed around her sickbed like bees, buzzing colonial bees, attracted by her title and family, the surprise of her crossing the ocean to join them. They rode in from their plantations, the Governor said, to see her. They brought her flowers, wines, cooling fever waters; they were profusely apologetic that she should be sick, as if it were their fault she had the ague. They chattered to her of their colony&#x2014;the vastness of its bay, the size of its rivers, the deadliness of its snakes&#x2014;as proud of its flaws as they were of its beauties.<br><br>They begged her to visit their plantations, and she could feel the curiosity burning in them as deeply as the fever burned in her. She was exotic, a novelty. A countess. A young widow. Someone seemingly rich and secure, above them in all ways. The granddaughter of one of England&#x2019;s most famous generals. Why was she here, they had to be wondering, when the world was hers in London?<br><br>Because the world was not hers in London. But, of course, she did not say so.<br><br>There was a sudden zigzag of blue-white lightning, and on shore, before her amazed eyes, a tree crackled, sizzled, and fell over, fire hissing in what was left.

HER STORIES WRITTEN WITH A DECEPTIVE SIMPLICITY, ARE AMONG THE MOST DISTURBING AND FASCINATING A READER CAN HOPE TO ENCOUNTER. MANY ARE ABOUT THE UNEASY CONJUNCTION OF OPPOSITES; OF EVIL AND SAINTLINESS, LOVE AND HATE, THE DIFFICULT WORLD OF CHILDHOOD AND THE DANGEROUSLY SIMPLE WORLD OF ADULTS. BORGES, WHO IS PROVIDING A PREFACE TO THIS COLLECTION, AS WRITTEN THAT THE CRUELTY OF HER STORIES IS NO DOUBT THE RESULT OF HER NOBILITY OF SOUL, A JUDGEMENT NO LESS PARADOXICAL THAN HER OWN WRITING.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: SpanishThis collection by the Argentine author contains stories written in the 1940s, '50s and '60s. All 32 pieces reflect Ocampo's emphasis on style over plot and characterization, and her predilection for the surreal and mystical. Manifest throughout and always voiced in Ocampo's subtle, understated tones are themes of sin and forgiveness, of love and infidelity, of illness, death and murder. In "Voice on the Telephone," Fernando declares that "children's parties depress me" and that he avoids lighting cigarettes, and then reveals that, at his fourth birthday party, he and his friends locked their mothers in a room and set fire to the house. In "The Sibyl," a burglar encounters a young girl in a home he is robbing; she unexpectedly tells him, " 'You are the Lord, because you have a beard . . . . A Lord, to whom we must give all that we have.' " And in the fascinating "The Punishment," a tormented woman tells her lover a backwards version of her life story, proceeding from present to past and admitting just before she dies, " 'Remembering the past is killing me.' " These tales are eerily compelling, and Ocampo is a master of graceful, delicate writing, admirably translated by Balderston. But ultimately, her concentration on surreal, stylized situations renders the works opaque, and detaches the reader from her characters. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Physics Squared</h2><p>Why should we care about Schr�dinger&#39;s poisoned cat?

It is also an explanation of new principles and an argument for different methods from those now in use. It is the first real alternative to conventional city planning that we have had in this century. Its author, herself a city dweller and an editor of<i> Architectural Forum</i>, is direct and practical in her approach. What, she asks, makes cities work? Why are some neighborhoods full of things to do and see and why are others dull? Why does the crime rate soar in our public housing developments and why are some of our older neighborhoods, despite their evident pov-erty, so much more safe, stable and congenial? Why do some neighborhoods attract interested and responsible populations and why do others degenerate? Why are Boston's North End and the eastern and western extremes of Greenwich Village good neighborhoods and why do orthodox city planners consider them slums? What alternatives are there to current city planning and rebuilding?<br><br>Conventional city planning holds that cities decline because they are blighted by too many people, by mixtures of commercial, industrial and residential uses, by old buildings and narrow streets and by small landholders who stand in the way of large-scale development. Such neighborhoods, they insist, breed apathy and crime, discourage investment and contaminate the areas around them. The response of con-ventional city planning is to tear them down, scatter their inhabitants, lay out super-blocks, and rebuild the area accord-ing to an integrated plan, with the result, as often as not, that the crime rate rises still higher, the new neighborhood is more lifeless than the old one, and the surrounding areas deteriorate even more, until the life of the whole city is threatened.<br><br>But Mrs. Jacobs observes that in any number of cases these very conditions--mixed uses, dense population, old buildings, small blocks, decentralized ownership--create the very opposite of slums, neighborhoods that regenerate themselves spontaneously, that are full of variety and diversity, that attract large numbers of casual visitors and responsible new residents, that encourage investment and revitalize the areas around them. Boston's North End (condemned as a slum by or-thodox planners) is such a neighborhood, and so is Greenwich Village. Rittenhouse Square and Telegraph Hill are others. Nearly every large city can produce still other examples.<br><br>Why then do some city neighborhoods die and why do others flourish? And what can city planners do to avoid the death and encourage the life of our great American cities? The solutions proposed by Mrs. Jacobs in this book represent a sharp break with conventional thinking on the subject and they carry with them the ring of simple truth which marks this book as an inevitable classic of social thought.<br> <br>This edition is set from the first American edition of 1961 and commemorates the seventy-fifth anniversary of Random House.</p><p>"The liveliness of her mind is a joy to behold, as is her common sense and a prose style uncluttered with the litter of empty jargon...her book is well and timely met." - <i>The Globe and Mail</i><br><br>"This is vintage Jane Jacobs: quietly authoritative, profoundly accessible, and disdainful of the blinkered viewpoints of academic theorists." - <i>The Calgary Herald</i><br><br>"Witty, beautifully written--the culmination of Jacobs' previous thinking, and a step forward that deftly invokes a broader philosophical, even metaphysical, context." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Jane Jacobs has become more than a person.

(science).</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, April 2013</strong>: Mary Roach&#x2019;s investigations into weird body science were inspired by a plastic torso with removable organs in her fifth-grade class, &#x201c;the point at which curiosity began to push aside disgust or fear or whatever it is that so reliably deflects mind from body.&#x201d; Since then, she&#x2019;s investigated death (<em>Stiff</em>), sex (<em>Bonk</em>), life after death (<em>Spooked</em>), and life in zero-gravity (<em>Packing for Mars</em>). Now, she cruises down the alimentary canal with <em>Gulp</em>. As you&#x2019;d expect with Roach, this isn&#x2019;t a methodical top-to-bottom tour. It&#x2019;s more delightful and memorable than that. She&#x2019;s a gorgeous writer, a master of sly asides, puns, and the bizarre but ultimately relevant story, sounding at times like an absurdly well-informed comedian (her footnotes are must-reads). And her evocative portraits of experts obsessed with their piece of the digestive puzzle--the surprising properties of saliva, nuances of chewing and digesting, and, yes, the incredible control of the colon--coaxes her readers beyond the gag reflex, inspiring awe for the world inside ourselves. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em>Mary Roach is the author of Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War, Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife, and Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers.

I knew I wanted to write a story set at a camp, similar to the one where I grew up. About the time I was looking for a story, two of my own children had friends from different families whose mothers told them they didn't want the kids living with them anymore. These were not problem kids. I'd have taken them into my home without reservation. So I couldn't understand what could make a mother say that to her child. And I couldn't bear the depth of pain those words must have inflicted on those kids' hearts. As I pondered the situation, I sensed the Spirit nudge me and say, "There's your story."<br>I hope you'll enjoy reading about the campers and staff of Rustic Knoll Bible Camp. It's a place where teens bring their baggage to camp...and gain a new perspective, a godly perspective on life.It's camp so real you can smell the campfire. No bug spray needed!&nbsp;Mary L.

In her words, "Watercolor likes to be danced with, not controlled." Relearn the playfulness of childhood, she argues; abandon the constant worry of whether the work is "good" or done the "right" way. If you concentrate on the processAthe experience of paintingAquality will emerge on its own. There are several fine books on watercolor from the rational school, like Jack Reid's Watercolor Basics: Let's Get Started (LJ 12/98). Lindsay's unique work will strike a chord with many beginning artists who respond to a more personal, even spiritual tone. So handsomely designed that it's hard to resist leafing through it, this holistic tome is highly recommended.<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Florida Straits</h2><p>Leaving a low-level Mafia job for a life on Key West, Joey Goldman is caught up in the world of the mob again when his half-brother, Gino, shows up on his doorstep</p><p>Joey Goldman's flying south for the winter.

And for an unikely hero out to make a killing, this could be Paradise . . . if he lives long enough.</p>Laurence Shames has been a New York City taxi driver, lounge singer, furniture mover, lifeguard, dishwasher, gym teacher, and shoe salesman. Having failed to distinguish himself in any of those professions, he turned to writing full-time in 1976 and has not done an honest day's work since. His basic laziness notwithstanding, Shames has published more than twenty books and hundreds of magazine articles and essays. Best known for his critically acclaimed series of Key West novels, he has also authored non-fiction and enjoyed considerable though largely secret success as a collaborator and ghostwriter. Shames has penned four New York Times bestsellers. These have appeared on four different lists, under four different names, none of them his own. This might be a record. Born in Newark, New Jersey in 1951, to chain-smoking parents of modest means but flamboyant emotions, Shames graduated summa cum laude from NYU in 1972 and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. Shortly after finishing college, he began annoying editors by sending them short stories they hated. He also wrote longer things he thought of as novels. He couldn't sell them. By 1979 he'd somehow passed himself off as a journalist and was publishing in top-shelf magazines like Playboy, Outside, Saturday Review, and Vanity Fair. In 1982, Shames was named Ethics columnist of Esquire, and also made a contributing editor to that magazine. By 1986 he was writing non-fiction books whose critical if not commercial success first established his credentials as a collaborator/ghostwriter. His 1991 national bestseller, BOSS OF BOSSES, written with two FBI agents, got him thinking about the Mafia. It also bought him a ticket out of New York and a sweet little house in Key West, where he finally got back to Plan A: writing fiction. Given his then-current preoccupations, the novels--beginning with FLORIDA STRAITS--naturally featured palm trees, high humidity, dogs in sunglasses, and blundering New York mobsters. Having had the good fortune to find a setting he loved and a wonderfully loyal readership as well, Shames wrote eight Key West novels during the 1990s, before taking a decade-long detour into screenwriting and collaborative work. In 2013, he returned to his favorite fictional turf with SHOT ON LOCATION--a suspenseful and hilarious mix of Hollywood glitz and Florida funky. TROPICAL SWAP, Shames&#x2019; tenth Key West novel, tells the riotous tale of a home exchange that sounds too good to be true, and is.</p><h2>R S BEST COUNTING BK EVR</h2><p>Introduces the numbers and counting from one to one hundred as Willy Bunny counts all the things he sees in one day.</p><p>Legendary American artist and writer Richard Scarry wrote and illustrated more than 300 books and has sold over 200 million copies worldwide.</p><h2>The Legacy (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book VII)</h2><p><i>Because of the friends I have known, the honorable people I have met, I know I am no solitary hero of unique causes.

Modeling their shows after the glitzy, daring reviews staged in the theaters of Paris, the Minsky brothers relied on grit, determination, and a few tricks that fell just outside the law&#x2014;and they would shape, and ultimately transform, the landscape of American entertainment. <br><br>With a supporting cast of such Jazz- and Depression-era heavyweights as Lucky Luciano, Harry Houdini, FDR, and Fanny Brice, Karen Abbott weaves a rich narrative of a woman who defied all odds to become a legend&#x2014;and whose sensational tale of tragedy and triumph embodies the American Dream.</p><p><b>A Letter from Author Karen Abbott</b> <br> <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> My grandmother used to tell me stories about growing up during the Great Depression, and she once related a tale about a cousin who saw Gypsy Rose Lee perform in 1935. &#x201c;She took a full fifteen minutes to peel off a single glove,&#x201d; the cousin said, &#x201c;and she was so damned good at it I would&#x2019;ve gladly given her fifteen more.&#x201d; This story got me thinking: who <i>was</i> Gypsy Rose Lee? And how did an awkward girl named Louise Hovick become her? I spent three years researching the answer, research that included connecting with Gypsy&#x2019;s late sister, the actress June Havoc; I was the last person to interview her. <p></p> When I arrived at June&#x2019;s Connecticut farm I found her lying in bed, her hair done up in pert white pigtails. She was ninety-four years old, give or take, and the legs that once danced on stages across the country were now motionless, two nearly imperceptible bumps tucked beneath crisp white sheets. Her eyes were a bold shade of blue and painfully sensitive to light. She told me the musical <i>Gypsy</i> distorted her childhood so thoroughly it was as if &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t own me anymore.&#x201d; She realized her sister was &#x201c;screwing me out in public,&#x201d; and that, in the end, there was no stopping either <i>Gypsy</i> or Gypsy; the play was both her sister&#x2019;s monument and her best chance for monumental revisionism. <p></p> It took another visit for June to share more personal memories: money was Gypsy&#x2019;s &#x201c;god,&#x201d; and she would do anything to anybody, including June, to make more of it. Gypsy did in fact do things, not only to June but also to herself&#x2014;&#x201c;terrible&#x201d; and &#x201c;awful&#x201d; and &#x201c;shocking&#x201d; things, things beneath her sister&#x2019;s formidable intellect and keen wit, things that made June believe, to that day, that love (even love fraught with competition and jealousy) never existed between them at all. <p></p> I asked and listened, for as much time as June gave me. I asked until her patience wore thin and her eyes watered with the effort to stay open. <p></p> &#x201c;I hope I didn&#x2019;t upset you today,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not my intention.&#x201d; <p></p> &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; June said. Those startling eyes found their focus, settling on mine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I couldn&#x2019;t be more open about some things... I&#x2019;m still ashamed for her. I wish they hadn&#x2019;t happened.&#x201d; <p></p> &#x201c;Would Gypsy wish the same?&#x201d; I asked. <p></p> &#x201c;She had no shame.&#x201d; <p></p> A pause, and I said, feebly, &#x201c;You were a good sister to her.&#x201d; <p></p> A hand tunneled out from the sheet. She coiled long, blade-thin fingers around my wrist. <p></p> &#x201c;I was no sister,&#x201d; June said. &#x201c;I was a knot in her life. I was nothing.&#x201d; <p></p> She retracted her hand, gave her eyes permission to close. I kissed her cheek and crept out the bedroom door. I was grateful she let me inside&#x2014;even on the periphery, even briefly�&#x2014;and I suspected she was saving her own questions for the day she reunited with the sister she did profess to love, the one she still called Louise. <p></p><b>The Monday Interview with Karen Abbott</b><b>Jan 03, 2011 - Publishers Weekly</b><b></b>An interview with Karen Abbott, whose <i><b>American Rose: A Nation Laid Bare--The Life and Times of Gypsy Rose Lee</b></i>--is out from Random House.<b>PW:</b> Why do you think we need another biography of Gypsy Rose Lee?<b>KA:</b> I don't consider American Rose to be a biography so much as a microcosm of 20th-century America, told through Gypsy's tumultuous life--it's "Horatio Alger meets Tim Burton." Here's an awkward kid who is born into nothing, receives very little formal education; spends her entire childhood on the road; is marginally cared for by an erratic, volatile mother; and grows up to become a novelist, a playwright, an actress, an activist, a member of New York's literati, and the most famous entertainer of her time. It's the American dream: the struggle, the setbacks, the ferocious drive and relentless self-invention, the ultimate triumph. Gypsy was a true original, and I hope a new generation can appreciate how unique and genuine she was, especially in this age of manufactured celebrity.Who else but Gypsy Rose Lee would receive a telegram from Eleanor Roosevelt--Eleanor Roosevelt!--that said "May your bare ass always be shining"?<b>PW:</b> The current movie, Burlesque, starring Cher and Christine Aguilera, has been applauded and derided; What would Gypsy Rose Lee think of the film--and what would she think of Cher?!<b>KA:</b> I think her reaction to the film would reflect that of many modern-day burlesque performers--that the acts in the movie bear little resemblance to those being performed today. Since its inception in the 1900s, burlesque has been a working-class art form, employing base humor to lampoon so-called high culture, and stripping became a vital component of the experience. If burlesque strives to be high culture it ceases to connect with its core audience, and it ceases to be burlesque. Gypsy believed that the character of stripping depended on the performer's attitude. "It's all mental," she once said. "If you think it's vulgar, the audience will think it's vulgar, too. But if you approach your work with a clean, aesthetic viewpoint, the audience senses your attitude." As for Cher, I think Gypsy would've been incredibly jealous of her singing talent--but would never have admitted it.<b>PW: </b>Did Gypsy have any sense of what was going on in the country, e.g., the Great Depression? How savvy was she outside the burlesque houses?<b>KA: </b>Gypsy was 18 when the stock market crashed,and I don't think she had any concept of what that meant, or what the repercussions would be. She just knew that vaudeville--the only life she'd ever known--had become extinct, and she was subsisting on sardines and dog food. During her first year in burlesque--a year she never spoke about, when she had likely resorted to prostitution--she experienced the hardships of the Great Depression firsthand. Gypsy soon learned that every stripper needed a gimmick and decided to incorporate her exceptional intelligence into her act, to become the "intellectual stripper." To that end. she read the latest books, magazines, and newspapers voraciously.She became politically active, and supported Spanish Loyalists during Spain's Civil War. She also became a fixture at Communist United Front meetings, and was investigated by the House Committee on un-American activities.<b>PW: </b>How and why did Gypsy, and burlesque, thrive during the worst economic time in America?<b>KA:</b> Vaudeville was characterized by sunny optimism, acts that were uplifting,cheerful, and clean. It provided a fanciful, magical escape, but after Black Friday the tone of American entertainment changed almost overnight. Vaudeville's buoyant spirit no longer spoke to the country's mood, but burlesque did, loud and clear. it was a different kind of escape; the performers and the audience were kindred spirits; they were all equally naked. Unemployed men would begin lining up in the afternoons to get into the evening shows. Few could afford to pay high ticket prices for Broadway productions, so the big producers lost business--and girls--to burlesque. Gypsy thrived because she was the first one to blend sex and comedy, to put on as much as she took off. She was a teaser more than a stripper, and audiences responded to that; they wanted her precisely because she was unobtainable.<b>PW:</b> Gypsy's mother, Rose Hovick, is considered to be the original pushy "stage mother." How did Gypsy cope with Rose, and vice versa?<b>KA:</b> The letters I discovered in my research reflected a constant whiplash back-and-forth of emotion between the women. Rose would blackmail Gypsy about her early days in burlesque and threaten to reveal her "true nature" to the press, and in the very next letter beg for forgiveness and tell Gypsy how much she loved her. Gypsy knew about all of Rose's secrets, as well--including where the literal bodies were buried. It was a co-dependent relationship that neither one could relinquish.<b>PW:</b> How did Louise Hovick view the woman she "created," Gypsy Rose Lee, and what did Gypsy think of the "real" Louise?<b>KA:</b> Gypsy the person had a conflicted, tortured relationship with Gypsy Rose Lee the creation. She was forever caught between her humble roots and her ambition to be accepted by New York's cultural and literary elite. For all of Gypsy's mental fortitude and steely nerve, she was physically weak and oddly susceptible to illness. Taking just one aspirin could upset her stomach, and she suffered from severe ulcers that made her vomit blood. She adored her creation because it gave her the things she'd always wanted--fame, money, security--but she loathed its limitations, either real or perceived. She lived in an exquisite trap she herself had set.</p><h2>A Guide to Being Born: Stories</h2><p>Reminiscent of Aimee Bender and Karen Russell&#x2014;an enthralling collection that uses the world of the imagination to explore the heart of the human condition.<br><br> Major literary talent Ramona Ausubel, author of <i>Sons and Daughters of Ease and Plenty</i>, coming Summer 2016, combines the otherworldly wisdom of her much-loved debut novel,&nbsp;<i>No One Is Here Except All of Us</i>, with the precision of the short-story form.&nbsp;<i>A Guide toBeing Born </i>is organized around the stages of life&#x2014;love, conception, gestation, birth&#x2014;and the transformations that happen as people experience deeply altering life events, falling in love, becoming parents, looking toward the end of life.

They do not know how they got there. It seems to be after�noon, the glare from the sun keeps them squinting. They wander carefully, canes and orthotics, across the slippery metal deck of the ship, not built for human passage but for cargo. Huge ship�ping crates are stacked at bow and stern. The grandmothers do not know what it means. Are we dead? they ask one an�other. Are we dying? Every part of the ship is metal, great sheets and hand-sized rivets. Cranes and transverses and bulkheads and longitudinals&#x2014;all metal. All painted white and now splayed with the gray stars of gull droppings.</p><p>Among the many hunched backs and stockinged legs, there is a woman named Alice, who finds the nicest bench and sits down on it. The bench looks out at the horizon, that line drawn by the eye to make an ending where there is not one. Alice is a lover of views, of great expanses, and she is happy now as she has always been, to look out. She thinks of her children on faraway spits of land. They have their studios and paints, their meditation cushions, their cars in need of oil changes and their grocery lists. She thinks about her one new great-granddaughter whom she has never met but who she hopes is wrapped in the gray blanket she knit.</p><p>Around Alice there are varying levels of commotion and flurry. Does anyone have a compass? Do you know how to drive a ship? Where is my nurse? I&#x2019;m from the DC area!</p><p>There are some grandmothers who try to escape immedi�ately. They get in a rescue craft tied to the side of the ship and sit holding their pocketbooks, waiting patiently to be lowered down to the tattered blue. Their faces become wet with wind-water, but they are not lowered. Their hairdos begin to wilt, but still, they do not get lowered.</p><p>There is the group of ladies whose eye makeup travels in dark tracks down cheeks; the group of proactive grandmothers who have taken scraps of paper and pens from their pocket�books and are brainstorming a list of suggestions, diagramming these suggestions in order of popularity and feasibility. In front of Alice is the group of rememberers, recounting as if centu�ries had passed, their lives. It used to be so easy, they remember at high volume due to a common loss of hearing. There were lovely smooth roads, and it was possible to get in the car and drive to different places where the pancakes were especially good, where the coffee was flown in from Italy.</p><p>But even in this situation, extraordinary and new, even with the churning ocean surrounding them completely, many of the grandmothers make small talk. They compliment each other&#x2019;s earrings. Are those pearls freshwater? The color reminds me of the curtains my mother bought on a trip to Bangkok, where she met the princess, if you can believe that.</p><p>Alice is joined by someone whose name she does not even listen to. The woman says, &#x201c;You are from Chicago, you say. How is Chicago this time of year?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s very cold on one day and then it&#x2019;s very warm the next day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And your children, what do they do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have two painters, a woodworker and a writer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How interesting,&#x201d; the woman says. &#x201c;Mine are all lawyers. I have six.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My father was a lawyer.&#x201d; Alice smiles. &#x201c;It was a terrible way to grow up. I&#x2019;m glad none of mine went that way.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s facial muscles seem to harden but are subverted by the skin hanging soft, always, no matter how tight her smile or her frown.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s possible I&#x2019;m dead,&#x201d; Alice says, looking at the differing blues of sky and water.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; Though the woman is looking at Alice, she seems to be most sorry for herself.</p><p>Alice nods. &#x201c;Yes, I guess I might have died. Or be dying.&#x201d; She remembers a hospital room and behind the bed a wall of machines, each emitting a very distinct beep that would draw a different nurse with a different tool. One brought Linda with a suction pump that gathered, painfully, the mucus from Alice&#x2019;s lungs. One brought Kera with a new bag of liquid food to be attached to the feeding tube. The room was always half dark, permanent evening. At all times at least one of her relatives was in the room.</p><p>Uneasily, the woman comforts, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice nods again and stretches her legs out, covered in the skin of stockings, and wiggles her feet at the ends.</p><p>&#x201c;Am I dead too, then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Did you die?&#x201d; Alice asks.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember dying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, maybe you didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>UNDER THE SETTING SUN, the ship is stained red. The deck looks like a high school cafeteria with small clusters of ladies huddled close together, constellated out over the surface. They remember to worry about things they had forgotten to worry about at first. The slippery surface is of great concern to many who fear the breaking of hips. They fret over husbands, who have been left at home with nothing in the refrigerator. Cats are likely pawing the heavy legs of couches. The couches will never survive the absence of the grandmothers. This will be the end of the couches. They talk about this. They huddle against the wind.</p><p>Some grandmothers who are quiet in the huddles do not have these things to go back to. Some have not turned off their televisions in years, not in the morning or at night. They have freezers full of food ready-packed for quick eating, and the dents in the cushions where they sit all day, their faces dimming and brightening in the light, are severe. The dents do not re-puff, because they do not have a chance to do so. They are al�ways under-butt. These grandmothers nervously check their watches still set to home-time, knowing that right now, right at this moment when the sun is falling, Pat Sajak is about to wel�come them, with the help of his generous audience, to Wheel!</p><p>Of! Fortune! Even though they will miss this television evening, those grandmothers, the ones with no one, are not so sorry to be here at sea with so many warm bodies.</p><p>While they trade stories of survival, the proactive grand�mothers who have no time for idle worrying are on a mission to find out what is inside the crates on deck. A set of bolt cutters has been discovered in the engine room. The engines were dis�covered there as well but were much too complicated to operate, so the ship continues to float, unrumbling.</p><p>These women have been in strange situations before. &#x201c;In Bermuda,&#x201d; someone says, fingering the gold buttons on her car�digan, &#x201c;right in the middle of our perfect vacation, a hurricane hit and we had to take the little girl who sold shell jewelry into our hotel room for two straight days. Poor thing had never had a Pepsi cola before,&#x201d; she recalls. &#x201c;Can you imagine?&#x201d; the fellow proactive grandmothers marvel.</p><p>Alice, meanwhile, walks the edge of the boat, passing a lady whose hands are busy clenching. &#x201c;Hullo,&#x201d; she says, nodding to the woman, the rail holder. The look she gets is a short, hopeful one, one that wants to see a man, any man, but a man in uniform especially. Any man in uniform with some kind of list. When she looks up to see another sagging female, she deflates.</p><p>Alice has been on a lot of boats. While she runs her hand along the railing, she remembers the first time and the last&#x2014; love early, love late. When she was seventeen years old, after an expensive wedding at her parents&#x2019; country house with none of her friends in attendance, she spent the first week as a wife on a sloop off the coast of Rhode Island. The first night, after navi�gating out of a very tricky harbor in a storm, her victorious hus�band came into the cabin where Alice was curled up. The small boat tossed in the heavy wind.</p><p>&#x201c;I would rather we went back,&#x201d; she managed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re very far away from anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The tide is against us. The dangerous thing would be to go back,&#x201d; he began, drying his glasses on a towel.</p><p>She insisted&#x2014;she told him she couldn&#x2019;t stand it out there. &#x201c;Please,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>He put the sail up and started the journey back. Alice, in�side, did not see the work he did to take her in. She did not see the boat list and scoop water onto his bare feet.</p><p>With the sound of the dock squeaking against the hull, they lay side by side, he reading by candlelight, she pretending to sleep, with only two ropes holding them steady.</p><p>In the morning she tried to be a wife. She got an egg from the small icebox and cracked it into the pan, but the yolk broke and bled. The yellow heart ran rivers over the white. She turned the heat off and left it there, dying. Alice jumped in the water in her nightgown and swam to the small dinghy attached to the hull of their boat, where she bobbed, her clothes sucked to her body.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; her husband yelled when he found her. She did not answer. He reeled her craft in until it knocked against his. &#x201c;Did you swim out?&#x201d; he asked, putting his hands on her wet head. &#x201c;You could have put on a bathing suit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not a good wife.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can learn.&#x201d; They sat in silence, the sound of water drip�ping off her and landing in the belly of the vessel. &#x201c;You stay here in your own little ship. You don&#x2019;t have to be anybody&#x2019;s wife here. I&#x2019;ll go make myself something to eat.&#x201d; He patted her and re�turned to his own boat, letting her rope go until she drifted back out to the maximum ten feet. The sea was a flat sheet going on until it couldn&#x2019;t anymore, until the sky pinned it down.</p><p>This was the beginning of a marriage that would continue into her fifties, when he left for good to start another family. She is sorry that she was not the one who pressed herself up against him to keep him warm when he was dying. Instead they corre�sponded by mail, and twice she sat on the porch swing outside his house with him and they talked about their children and their grandchildren, those lives they had made together, while his wife kept herself busy in the house.</p><p>Her second marriage was also more than thirty years long. He had said, &#x201c;Please, there is no reason not to marry me. I am smart and kind and I will do the dishes.&#x201d; This wedding, just like the first, took place at her parents&#x2019; house, only this time she was driven off in a golf cart instead of put on a sailboat.</p><p>They were retired for almost the entire duration, and for years before he died, they traveled often by freighter, where they were the only two paying passengers, sitting together on deck and doing the Jumble while the crew called commands to one another. Her husband couldn&#x2019;t see well as he got old, so she&#x2019;d narrate the journey for him. &#x201c;On the left there is an old fishing shack. It has fallen down on one side and the porch now hangs into the water. There are vines pulling it under. Two big birds are standing on the roof.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are they egrets?&#x201d; he wanted to know.</p><p>&#x201c;No, they are great blue herons.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I was picturing egrets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, they aren&#x2019;t. But they are very nice-looking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they are. I was just picturing egrets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it doesn&#x2019;t matter now because that shack has passed. Now we are coming to a town. There are three little girls stand�ing in the mud in their bathing suits, waving. Do you hear them calling to us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sort of.&#x201d; They both listened hard, the young voices making their way over the surface of the water.</p><p>&#x201c;Do they have bicycles?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Why would they have bicycles?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or fishing poles? How did they get there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They just have hands. They are only trying to say hello.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, hello then!&#x201d; he called back. &#x201c;Hello!&#x201d; The two of them called together, their arms working back and forth like a pair of windshield wipers, trying to clear the view ahead.</p><p>WHEN ALICE&#x2019;S CIRCUMNAVIGATION takes her around to the bow of the ship, she finds the proactive grandmothers surrounding the crates like flies. They are furious with curiosity about what is inside, what they are carrying with them on some unknown body of water. &#x201c;Perhaps there are beautiful Chinese green beans or Italian leather coats,&#x201d; says one. &#x201c;Maybe they are full of the most luxurious furs,&#x201d; tries another. &#x201c;I think it will be jewels!&#x201d; shrieks another, though this seems optimistic to everyone else.</p><p>What they find are none of those things. When the lock springs open on the first crate and the doors too, what they see inside are rows of white. Someone pulls, and to her feet fall five toilet seats. They are the padded kind, sighing under the weight of the sitter. There must be hundreds of them in there. This crate is quickly abandoned in disappointment, though Alice has put a toilet seat over her head and wears it, to everyone&#x2019;s enjoy�ment, like a necklace.</p><p>In the next crate they find child-size wooden baseball bats with the words &#x201c;Sluggy Bat&#x201d; written in wide cursive. This find interests no one, except one short lady who inches a bat out of the middle and swings it, remembering playing with her sisters in the street and pleased to find that it is a nice weight for her.</p><p>Crate number three is full&#x2014;full!&#x2014;of yellow roses. The grandmothers hug them in bundles to their chests, their arms pricked by the thorns. They distribute the flowers around&#x2014; handing the wilting bouquets out to their fellow passengers until they all look like prom queens ready to dance their victory dance, the thorns freckling their arms with blood.</p><p>EVEN HERE, evening comes and then night. The grandmoth�ers go inside to the galley, where they make their way through the first of many cases of canned peaches, sharing a single can opener found in a drawer. They discover that the toilet seats improve the comfort of the sitter on hard benches. They begin and end card games and word games. They quiz one another on presidential trivia. They begin to slump, exhausted.</p><p>Around them are the roses on the floor, the countertop, the cheap wood tables with names carved into them&#x2014;Danny and Phoung, Rocko, the shape of a penis now covered by some blooms. Roses are worn behind ears and tucked into button�holes. They smell as they are supposed to.</p><p>The grandmothers feel farther and farther away.</p><p>As they huddle, even under the wrap of polyester blankets taken from bunks, the work of their bodies is almost visible&#x2014; the sinews of muscle responding again and again to the heart&#x2019;s insistence. Dozens of kerosene lanterns flicker, and the grand�mothers, whose eyes are falling shut but who do not want to go alone to their cabins, who fear that this might be it for them, begin to ask one another questions.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me the story of my life,&#x201d; someone asks. &#x201c;Tell me what I was like when I was a baby.&#x201d; And they can do it. They get the details wrong&#x2014;locations of birth, names of parents and siblings&#x2014;but this does not matter to anyone. They chime in, an�swering together, bit by bit. &#x201c;Your mother was so happy to meet you,&#x201d; someone says. &#x201c;Your father brought the congratulatory tiger lilies right up to your new nose,&#x201d; another adds.

Beginning with the pacesetting automotive pyrotechnics first brought to the screen in Bullitt, Jesse Crosse shows us the world&#x2019;s great filmmakers following suit&#x2014;stretching creative talents, technology, budgets, and sometimes credibility to create the most amazing car chase sequences ever filmed.</p><p>In the 1980s, Jesse Crosse helped launch one of the major British car magazines of the decade, Performance Car. Today he writes for Autocar, Car Graphic, The Daily Telegraph, and many other publications. He is also a racer at heart, competing in touring cars and Formula Fords, as well as being the proud owner of a 1946 MG TC and a 1967 E-Type Jaguar. <p>Film, obviously, is another of Crosse&#x2019;s passions. That&#x2019;s why when he found out that there was no authority on the all-important subject of movie car chases, he became one. Along the way, Jesse consulted many friends, colleagues, and even strangers as to not only what the best movie car chases are but what really makes up a great movie car chase. This book is the culmination of those efforts . . . and his recently burgeoning DVD collection.</p><b><i>New York Times, </i>Dec. 10, 2006</b>"Once you read this very entertaining book, you will risk your ability to suspend disbelief the next time you watch a movie car chase.

However, she is a little put out when she doesn&#x2019;t receive the warm country welcome she expected. But, keen to avoid a certain man back in London, Flora sets about rebuilding the crumbling business.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Katie Fforde&#x2019;s six previous novels include<i> </i><b>Life Skills</b> and most recently, the bestselling <b>Thyme Out</b>.<b>Bidding for Love</b><br><b>Chapter One</b>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A yowl from the plastic box at her feet made Flora look down anxiously. Was Imelda actually having kittens, or was she still just complaining about being shut up in a pet carrier on a hot summer day?'Not now, sweetie, please!' Flora implored through gritted teeth. 'Just hang on until I've got this meeting over. Then I'll find you a nice bed and breakfast where they like cats.'Aware that her pleadings were really a displacement activity, Flora picked up the yowling Imelda, hooked her handbag over her shoulder, hitched her overnight bag over her arm and went up the steps. She was slightly regretting her new shoes. They were divinely pretty with a heavenly fake peony between the toes, but not worn in and therefore killingly uncomfortable. Not one to sacrifice prettiness for comfort, Flora ignored the incipient blisters and pressed the bell. Seeing her own surname on the brass plate above it gave her a strange thrill. The family firm, and she was joining it.The door was opened by a tall woman wearing a lot of navy blue. She was a little older than Flora, and had a no-nonsense look about her which inevitably made Flora think of Girl Guides. My shoes may be not quite suitable, thought Flora, to give herself confidence, but nor is that colour in this heat. In other circumstances, Flora realised, she would yearn to do a Trinny and Susannah on her.'Hello,' said the woman, smiling professionally, 'youmust be Flora. Do come in. We're so looking forward to meeting you. Especially Charles.'Flora smiled too. 'I hope you won't mind, but I've got my cat with me. I can't leave her in the car in this heat. Apart from anything else, she's very pregnant.'A little frown appeared between the woman's eyebrows as she looked down at the box. 'Oh, well, no, I'm sure it will be fine for a short time. Although I'm terribly allergic, I'm afraid.''Oh dear. I suppose I could leave her outside the door ...' Flora bit her lip to indicate that in fact she couldn't t leave Imelda anywhere except at her feet. 'But she might have her kittens at any moment.''You'd better come in,' said the woman, her professional manner beginning to fray. 'We're in here.' She opened the door of a room which was mostly filled with a table, around which were several empty chairs.The room's sole occupant, a tall, conventionally handsome man wearing a dark suit and a very conservative tie, got up. Obviously Charles, her cousin fifteen million times removed.Not promising. Flora depended on her charm to ease her way through life and had learnt to spot the few with whom this wouldn't work. He was a classic example, she could tell; he didn't like girls with pretty shoes, strappy dresses and amusing jewellery He liked sensible girls who wore driving shoes, or plain leather courts with medium heels. His idea of good taste was a single row of real pearls with matching earrings, and possibly a bangle on special occasions.When the woman who had brought her in (displaying all these signs of proper dress sense) touched his arm and said, 'Darling, this is Flora,' Flora wasn't at all surprised to see the sapphire and diamond engagement ring on her left hand. They made the perfect County couple.'Flora,' said Charles, holding out his hand. 'How niceto meet you after all these years.' He didn't sound all that pleased.'Mm.' Flora shook the hand, smiled and nodded; she wasn't that pleased, either. She had totally reorganised her life to take a part in the family business with, she realised now, desperately inadequate research. Charles and his worthy, conventionally dressed fianc�e didn't want her, wouldn't make her welcome, and her spell in the country could turn out to be horribly dull. Still, she'd made her bed, and she'd have to lie on it - at least until the sub-let on her London flat expired. 'It's very nice to meet you, too. I can't think why we haven't met before.''You spent quite a lot of your early life out of the country,' he said soberly, as if she might have forgotten.'I suppose that explains it. We did miss out on quite a lot of family weddings.' She smiled. 'Though perhaps I won't miss out on the next one?''Oh yes, haven't you two introduced yourselves? This is Annabelle, Annabelle Stapleton. My fianc�e and possible future partner in the business.' His smile, though conventional, did at least prove he brushed his teeth, which was something.'How nice,' said Flora, wishing she'd made more enquiries about the business before telling that nice man of course he could have her flat for at least six months, she wouldn't be needing it.'Yes,' agreed Charles. 'Now, let's sit down and discuss your part in Stanza and Stanza.''Would anyone like a glass of water first?' suggested Annabelle.'Oh, yes please,' said Flora. 'And could I post a little to Imelda? In the box? I need to check on her anyway.' Flora delivered one of her most appealing smiles to her distant cousin, a last-ditch attempt to get him on her side. 'I wouldn't have brought her if there'd been any alternative, I assure you.''That's fine,' said Charles smoothly, almost, but not quite, concealing his impatience. Then, when the water had been dispensed and the cat seen to, he said, 'Tell me, Flora, I hope this isn't a rude question, but how much do you actually know about antiques and the auction business?'Flora took another sip of water. 'Ah well, you pick up things like that as you go along, don't you?''Do you?' asked Charles, who had, she now noticed, rather strange grey-blue eyes which, beneath his sceptical eyebrows, had the look of the North Sea in winter.'Well, yes.' Flora tried to think of a suitable phrase, to indicate she knew more than what she had gleaned from a lot of recent, frantic watching of various afternoon television programmes on the subject. 'Cheap as chips' didn't seem to apply. 'Of course,' she said airily, 'having spent so much of my youth in Europe, I'm not so up on English furniture.''But you must be au fait with all those glorious ceramics,' said Annabelle. 'I adore ceramics.'Just for a moment, Flora felt unsure what ceramics were. 'Oh, you mean china and stuff? Yes, I love it too. I collect teapots, funny ones, you know?'Charles winced visibly. 'I think we'd better get on.''Well, yes, we'd better,' said Flora rashly. 'But I do wonder if we will.''What on earth are you talking about?' said Charles. 'Now ...' He opened a file and drew out a sheaf of papers. He was not a man who would get behind with his paperwork. He had that look about him. He was a filer and a putter-into-alphabetical-order-er. It was painfully clear.'Now,' he began, 'our mutual great-uncle left things slightly awkwardly.''Did he?' asked Flora. 'I thought it was all quite straightforward. You'd already inherited forty-nine per cent from your father, and I got fifty-one per cent when Uncle Clodiodied. Clear as sixteenth-century window glass, or something. Although I realise I wouldn't normally have been expected to inherit,' she added as consolation.'Yes,' explained Charles, openly irritable now. 'But it is awkward. You own more than me. And you know nothing about the business and I've been running this auction house all my life, more or less.''Well, obviously I'm not going to sweep in here and make huge changes!' Flora made an extravagant gesture with her arms, observing at the same time that a good sweep, on the floor at least, would be a good idea. 'I want to learn about the business I'm going to be part of.'Charles and Annabelle exchanged questioning glances. 'That's encouraging,' said Charles warily, 'but it still doesn't quite settle the matter. I can't have you having more shares than I have. It doesn't make sense, on any level.'The cat yowled, possibly showing solidarity with Charles.'Sorry, I must have a peek. In case this is it.''It?''The moment when she really is going to give birth. It's her first litter, you see, and the kittens can come in about thirty minutes from when she starts. I've read all about it.'While Flora fussed with the cat she thought about her own situation. She was obviously totally unwelcome and Charles was horrible. Which was a shame - she hardly ever disliked people. She'd probably better make an alternative plan. Staying in the depths of the country with a couple who deeply resented her presence was not going to be a lot of fun. 'If it wasn't for you, Imelda,' she breathed inaudibly, 'I'd hightail it out of town right now.''Tell me,' said Charles, when Flora was again upright, sitting back in her uncomfortable chair. 'What exactly do you hope to get out of your trip down here?' The grey-blueeyes were penetrating and cold - they really were just like the North Sea. Flora felt she was being interviewed for a job for which she had no qualifications - which, in a way, she was. She struggled to remind herself that, technically at least, she was more powerful than Charles.She took a breath and didn't let herself be distracted by Imelda's yowl. 'I haven't been brought up in the business like you have, but I have known about it. I didn't expect to inherit, as I said. It was such a shock to everyone when Niccol� was killed in that car accident and even then, I never thought Uncle Clodio -- did you know him, by the way? He was lovely - would leave it to me.''No. I didn't know him.''It broke his heart when Nicki died, obviously.''It must have been terrible,' murmured Annabelle.'But really, we -- my parents and I -- were totally surprised when we heard about how he'd left things.''Then I absolve you of forcing him to change his will on his death-bed,' said Charles dryly. 'But it still leaves us in a difficult posit...</p><h2>Cooking With the Horse &amp; Buggy People</h2><p><p>FREE SHIPPING ON THIS ITEM!</p> <p>A COLLECTION OF OVER 600 FAVORITE AMISH RECIPES FROM THE HEART OF HOLMES COUNTY OHIO.</p> <p>Cooking with the Horse and Buggy People is a collection of over 600 favorite recipes of Amish families throughout Ohio's Holmes County.</p> <p>From mouth watering main dishes to kitchen dream desserts, Cooking with the Horse and Buggy People will help you prepare it all.</p> <p>If you desire originality, if you respect authenticity, if the Amish way of cooking satisfies your taste palate, Cooking with the Horse and Buggy People is for you.</p> <p></p></p><p></p><h2>The Z Was Zapped</h2><p>A dramatic black-and-white presentation of the alphabet in which the two-time Caldecott Medalist depicts a mysterious transformation of each letter.</p><p>Chris Van Allsburg is the winner of two Caldecott Medals, for Jumanji and The Polar Express, as well as the recipient of a Caldecott Honor Book for The Garden of Abdul Gasazi. The author and illustrator of numerous picture books for children, he has also been awarded the Regina Medal for lifetime achievement in children&#x2019;s literature. In 1982, Jumanji won the National Book Award and in 1996, it was made into a popular feature film. Chris Van Allsburg was formerly an instructor at the Rhode Island School of Design. He lives in Rhode Island with his wife and two children.Van Allsburg's latest is not an alphabet book but an "alphabet theatre": as its title page proclaims, it is "a play in twenty-six acts, performed by the Caslon Players, written and directed by Mr. Chris Van Allsburg." In it, each letter of the alphabet is shown on a draped curtained stage, undergoing some sort of (usually ominous) transformation. Turning the page reveals the text that spells out the alphabetical event: the A was in an avalanche; the B was badly bitter; the C was cut to ribbons; and so on. This is an original and unusual undertaking, executed with both visual and verbal adroitness. In technique it most resembles Van Allsburg's The Mysteries of Harris Burdick; in both books, black pencil is used with remarkable skill to create the richness of texture and shading usually associated with full color. It is perhaps closest to Harris Burdick in ambition as well, in the sense that an imaginative challenge is presented to the reader (here, to come up with a verbal account of the pictured transformation before turning the page to find it). But the imaginative possibilities of the "alphabet theatre" are limited; this alphabet book format is more of an intriguing design element than a way to teach the ABCs. The picture and text that belong to a single letter are not on facing pages. While Van Allsburg's visual ingenuity is in full evidence (among his hauntingly realistic images are the evaporating E and the jittery J), there is both a sinister quality and an stagey dimension to the work. Artistically, a virtuoso performance, but one with an undeniably cold cast.

Or so it was thought. In the best selling book The Riddle of the Titanic, Robin Gardiner and his co-author Dan van der Vat shocked the world with their claims that it was not, in fact, the Titanic but the sister ship, the Olympic, which finished its days amidst the icy waters of the North Atlantic on that fateful night.

The man behind the kidnapping? None other than Nikolei Drevin, wealthiest developer in the world, and the man who single-handedly is funding the first luxury hotel in outer space, Ark Angel. Yet the project is hemorrhaging millions of dollars along the way, and Drevin will stop at nothing to cease the bleeding. Even if it means blowing up Ark Angel. Even if it means sacrificing his only son. . . .</p><p>Anthony Horowitz's life might have been copied from the pages of Charles Dickens or the Brothers Grimm. Born in 1956 in Stanmore, Middlesex, to a family of wealth and status, Anthony was raised by nannies, surrounded by servants and chauffeurs. His father, a wealthy businessman, was, says Mr. Horowitz, "a fixer for Harold Wilson." What that means exactly is unclear &#x2014; "My father was a very secretive man," he says&#x2014; so an aura of suspicion and mystery surrounds both the word and the man. As unlikely as it might seem, Anthony's father, threatened with bankruptcy, withdrew all of his money from Swiss bank accounts in Zurich and deposited it in another account under a false name and then promptly died. His mother searched unsuccessfully for years in attempt to find the money, but it was never found. That too shaped Anthony's view of things. Today he says, "I think the only thing to do with money is spend it." His mother, whom he adored, eccentrically gave him a human skull for his 13th birthday. His grandmother, another Dickensian character, was mean-spirited and malevolent, a destructive force in his life. She was, he says, "a truly evil person", his first and worst arch villain. "My sister and I danced on her grave when she died," he now recalls.<p>A miserably unhappy and overweight child, Anthony had nowhere to turn for solace. "Family meals," he recalls, "had calories running into the thousands.... I was an astoundingly large, round child...." At the age of eight he was sent off to boarding school, a standard practice of the times and class in which he was raised. While being away from home came as an enormous relief, the school itself, Orley Farm, was a <i>grand guignol</i> horror with a headmaster who flogged the boys till they bled. "Once the headmaster told me to stand up in assembly and in front of the whole school said, 'This boy is so stupid he will not be coming to Christmas games tomorrow.' I have never totally recovered." To relieve his misery and that of the other boys, he not unsurprisingly made up tales of astounding revenge and retribution.</p><p>So how did an unhappy boy, from a privileged background, metamorphose into the creator of Alex Rider, fourteen-year-old spy for Britain's MI6? Although his childhood permanently damaged him, it also gave him a gift &#x2014; it provided him with rich source material for his writing career. He found solace in boyhood in the escapism of the James Bond films, he says. He claims that his two sons now watch the James Bond films with the same tremendous enjoyment he did at their age. Bond's glamour translates perfectly to the 14-year-old psyche, the author says. "Bond had his cocktails, the car and the clothes. Kids are just as picky. It's got to be the right Nike trainers (sneakers), the right skateboard. And I genuinely think that 14-year-olds are the coolest people on the planet. It's this wonderful, golden age, just on the cusp of manhood when everything seems possible."</p><p>Alex Rider is unwillingly recruited at the age of fourteen to spy for the British secret service, MI6. Forced into situations that most average adults would find terrifying and probably fatal, young Alex rarely loses his cool although at times he doubts his own courage. Using his intelligence and creativity, and aided by non-lethal gadgets dreamed up by MI6's delightfully eccentric, overweight and disheveled Smithers, Alex is able to extricate himself from situations when all seems completely lost. What is perhaps more terrifying than the deeply dangerous missions he finds himself engaged in, is the attitude of his handlers at MI6, who view the boy as nothing more than an expendable asset.</p><p>The highly successful Alex Rider novels include <i>Stormbreaker</i>, <i>Point Blank</i>, <i>Skeleton Key</i>, and the recent <i>Eagle Strike</i>.</p><p>Anthony Horowitz is perhaps the busiest writer in England. He has been writing since the age of eight, and professionally since the age of twenty. He writes in a comfortable shed in his garden for up to ten hours per day. In addition to the highly successful Alex Rider books, he has also written episodes of several popular TV crime series, including <i>Poirot, Murder in Mind, Midsomer Murders and Murder Most Horrid</i>. He has written a television series <i>Foyle's Wa</i>r, which recently aired in the United States, and he has written the libretto of a Broadway musical adapted from Dr. Seuss's book, <i>The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.</i> His film script <i>The Gathering</i> has just finished production. And...oh yes...there are more Alex Rider novels in the works. Anthony has also written the <i>Diamond Brothers</i> series.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><b>Chapter 2</b><p>The nurse was twenty-three years old, blonde, and nervous. This was only her second week at St. Dominic&#x2019;s, one of London&#x2019;s most exclusive private hospitals. Rock stars and television celebrities came here, she had been told. There were also VIPs from abroad. VIPs here meant very important patients. Even famous people get sick, and the ones who wanted to recover in five-star comfort chose St. Dominic&#x2019;s. The surgeons and therapists were world-class. The hospital food was so good that some patients had been known to pretend they were ill so that they could enjoy it for a while longer.That evening, the nurse was making her way down a wide, brightly lit corridor, carrying a tray of medicines. She was wearing a freshly laundered white dress. Her name&#x2014;d. meacher&#x2014;was printed on a badge pinned to her uniform. Several of the junior doctors had already placed bets on which of them would persuade her to go out with them first.</p><p>She stopped in front of an open door. Room nine.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Diana Meacher.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking forward to meeting you too,&#x201d; the boy in room nine replied.</p><p>Alex Rider was sitting up in bed, reading a French textbook that he should have been studying at school. He was wearing pajamas that had fallen open at the neck and the nurse could just make out the bandages crisscrossing his chest. He was a very handsome boy, she thought. He had fair hair and serious brown eyes that looked as though they had seen too much. She knew that he was only fourteen, but he looked older. Pain had done that to him. Nurse Meacher had read his medical file and understood what he had been through.</p><p>In truth, he should have been dead. Alex Rider had been hit by a bullet fired from a .22 rifle from a distance of almost 250 feet. The sniper had been aiming for his heart&#x2014;and if the bullet had found its target, Alex would have had no chance of surviving. But nothing is certain&#x2014;not even murder. A tiny movement had saved his life. As he had come out of MI6&#x2019;s headquarters on Liverpool Street, he had stepped off the sidewalk, his right foot carrying his body down toward the level of the road. It was at that exact moment that the bullet had hit him, and instead of powering into his heart, it had entered his body half an inch higher, ricocheting off a rib and exiting horizontally under his left arm.</p><p>The bullet had missed his vital heart structures, but even so, it had done plenty of damage, tearing through the subclavian artery, which carries blood over the top of the lung and into the arm. This was what Alex had felt when he was hit. As blood had poured out of the severed artery, filling the space between the lung and the thoracic cage, he had found himself unable to breathe. Alex could easily have died from shock or loss of blood. If he had been a man, he almost certainly would have. But the body of a child is different from that of an adult. A young person&#x2019;s artery will automatically shut itself down if cut&#x2014;doctors can&#x2019;t explain how or why&#x2014;and this will limit the amount of blood lost. Alex was unconscious, but he was still breathing, four minutes later, when the first ambulance arrived.There wasn&#x2019;t much the paramedics could do: IV fluids, oxygen, and some gentle compression around the bullet&#x2019;s point of entry. But that was enough. Alex had been rushed to St. Dominic&#x2019;s, where surgeons had removed the bone fragments and put a graft on the artery. He had been in the operating room two and a half hours.And now he was looking almost as if nothing had happened. As the nurse came into the room, he closed the book and settled back into his pillows. Diana Meacher knew that this was his last night in the hospital. He had been here for ten days and tomorrow he was going home. She also knew that she wasn&#x2019;t allowed to ask too many questions. It was there in large print on his file:</p><p>PATIENT 9/75958 RIDER/ALEX:</p><p>SPECIAL STATUS (MISO). </p><p>NO UNAUTHORIZED VISITORS. NO PRESS. </p><p>REFER ALL INQUIRIES TO DR. HAYWARD.</p><p>It was all very strange. She had been told she would meet some interesting people at St. Dominic&#x2019;s, and she had been required to sign a confidentiality clause before she began work. But she&#x2019;d never expected anything like this. MISO stood for Military Intelligence: Special Operations. But what was the secret service doing with a teenage boy? How had Alex managed to get himself shot? And why had there been two armed policemen sitting outside his room for the first four days of his stay? Diana tried to push these thoughts out of her mind as she put the tray down. Maybe she should have stuck with the NHS.&#x201c;How are you feeling?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looking forward to going home?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>Diana realized she was staring at Alex and turned her attention to the medicines. &#x201c;Are you in any pain?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Can I get you something to help you sleep?&#x201d;&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m all right.&#x201d; Alex shook his head and for a moment something flickered in his eyes. The pain in his chest had slowly faded, but he knew it would never leave him completely. He could feel it now, vague and distant, like a bad memory.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like me to come back later?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s all right, thanks.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need anyone to tuck me in.&#x201d;</p><p>Diana blushed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I meant,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But if you need me, I&#x2019;ll be just down the hall. You can call me anytime.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I might do that.&#x201d;</p><p>The nurse picked up her tray and walked out of the room. She left behind the scent of her perfume&#x2014;heather and spring flowers&#x2014;in the air. Alex sniffed. It seemed to him that since his injury, his senses had become more acute.</p><p>He reached for his French book, then changed his mind. To hell with it, he thought. Irregular verbs could wait. It was his own future that concerned him more.He looked around at the neat, softly lit room that tried hard to pretend it belonged to an expensive hotel rather than a hospital. There was a TV on a table in the corner, operated by a remote control beside the bed. A window looked out over a wide north London street lined with trees. His room was on the second floor, one of about a dozen arranged in a ring around a bright and modern reception area. In the early days after his operation, there had been flowers everywhere, but Alex had asked for them to be taken away. They&#x2019;d reminded him of a funeral parlor and he had decided he preferred being alive.</p><p>But there were still cards. He had received more than twenty and he&#x2019;d been surprised how many people had heard that he&#x2019;d been hurt&#x2014;and how many had sent a card. There had been a dozen from school: one from the head; one from Miss Bedfordshire, the school secretary; and several from his friends. Tom Harris had sent him some photos taken on their trip to Venice and a note:</p><p>They told us it&#x2019;s appendercitis but I bet it isn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Get well soon anyway.</p><p>Tom was the only person at Brookland who knew the truth about Alex.</p><p>Sabina Pleasure had somehow discovered he was in the hospital and had sent him a card from San Francisco. She was enjoying life in America but missed England, she said. She was hoping to come over for Christmas. Jack Starbright had sent him the biggest card in the room and had followed it up with chocolates, magazines, and energy drinks, visiting him twice a day. There was even a card from the prime minister&#x2019;s office&#x2014;although it seemed the prime minister had been too busy to sign it.</p><p>And there had been cards from MI6. One from Mrs. Jones, another from Alan Blunt (a printed message with a single word&#x2014;blunt&#x2014;signed in green ink as if it were a memorandum, not a get-well card). Alex had been surprised and pleased to receive a card from Wolf, the soldier he had met while training with the SAS. The postmark showed it had been mailed in Baghdad. But his favorite had been sent by Smithers. On the front was a teddy bear. There was no message inside, but when Alex opened the card, the teddy bear&#x2019;s eyes blinked and it began to talk.</p><p>&#x201c;Alex&#x2014;very sorry to hear you&#x2019;ve been hurt.&#x201d; The bear was speaking with Smithers&#x2019; voice. &#x201c;Hope you get better soon, old chap. Just take it easy&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sure you deserve a rest. Oh, and by the way, this card will self-destruct in five seconds.&#x201d;</p><p>Sure enough, to the horror of the nurses, the card had immediately burst into flames.</p><p>As well as cards, there had been visitors. Mrs. Jones had been the first.</p><p>Alex had only just come around after surgery when she appeared. He had never seen the deputy head of Special Operations looking quite so unsure of herself. She was wearing a charcoal-gray raincoat, which hung open to reveal a dark suit underneath. Her hair was wet and raindrops glistened on her shoulders.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t quite know what to say to you, Alex,&#x201d; she began. She hadn&#x2019;t asked him how he was. She would have already gotten that from the doctors. &#x201c;What happened to you on Liverpool Street was an unforgivable lapse of security. Too many people know the location of our headquarters. We&#x2019;re going to stop using the main entrance. It&#x2019;s too dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>Alex shifted uncomfortably in the bed but said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;Your condition is stable. I can&#x2019;t tell you how relieved I am personally. When I heard you&#x2019;d been shot, I . . .&#x201d; She stopped herself. Her black eyes looked down, taking in the tubes and wires attached to the boy lying in front of her, feeding into his arm, nose, mouth, and stomach. &#x201c;I know you can&#x2019;t talk now,&#x201d; she went on. &#x201c;So I&#x2019;ll be brief.</p><p>&#x201c;You are safe here. We&#x2019;ve used St. Dominic&#x2019;s before, and certain procedures are being followed. There are guards outside your room. Someone will be there twenty-four hours a day as long as necessary.</p><p>&#x201c;The shooting on Liverpool Street was reported in the press, but your name was kept out of it. Your age too. The sniper who fired at you had taken a position on the roof opposite. We&#x2019;re still investigating how he managed to get up there without being detected&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m afraid we&#x2019;ve been unable to find him. But right now, your safety is our primary concern. We can talk to Scorpia. As you know, we&#x2019;ve had dealings with them in the past. I&#x2019;m sure I can persuade them to leave you alone. You destroyed their operation, Alex, and they punished you. But enough is enough.&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped. Alex&#x2019;s heart monitor pulsed softly in the dim light.</p><p>&#x201c;Please try not to think too badly of us,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;After everything you&#x2019;ve been through&#x2014;Scorpia, your father . . . I will never forgive myself for what happened. I sometimes think it was wrong of us ever to get you involved in the first place. But we can talk about that another time.&#x201d;</p><p>Alex was too weak to reply. He watched as Mrs. Jones got up and left, and he guessed that Scorpia must have decided to leave him alone, because a few days later the armed guards outside his room quietly disappeared.</p><p>And now, in just over twelve hours, he would be out of here too. Jack had already been planning the weeks ahead. She wanted to take him on vacation to Florida or perhaps the Caribbean. It was October and the summer was definitely over, leaves falling and cold breezes coming in with the night. Jack wanted Alex to rest and regain his strength in the sun&#x2014;but secretly he wasn&#x2019;t so sure. He picked up the textbook again. He never thought he&#x2019;d hear himself say this, but the truth was he just wanted to go back to school. He wanted to be ordinary again. Scorpia had sent him a simple, unforgettable message. Being a spy could get him killed. Irregular verbs were less dangerous.</p><p>There was a movement at the door and a boy looked in.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Alex.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy had a strange accent&#x2014;Eastern European, possibly Russian. He was fourteen, with short blond hair and light blue eyes. His face was thin, his skin pale. He was wearing pajamas and a large dressing gown, which made him seem smaller than he was. He was staying in the room next door to Alex and really had been treated for appendicitis, with complications. His name was Paul Drevin&#x2014;the surname was somehow familiar&#x2014;but Alex didn&#x2019;t know anything more about him. The two of them had spoken briefly a few times. They were nearly the same age, and the only teenagers on the corridor.</p><p>Alex raised a hand in greeting. &#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hear you&#x2019;re getting out of here tomorrow,&#x201d; Paul said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. How about you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Another day, worst luck.&#x201d; He hovered in the doorway. He seemed to want to come in, but at the same time something held him back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be glad to leave,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;I want to go home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where is home?&#x201d; Alex asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d; Paul was completely serious. &#x201c;We live in London a lot of the time. But my father&#x2019;s always moving. Moscow, New York, the South of France . . . he&#x2019;s been too busy even to come in and see me. And we have so many houses, I sometimes wonder which is my home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where do you go to school?&#x201d; Alex had picked up on the mention of Moscow and assumed that Paul must be Russian.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t go to school; I have tutors.&#x201d; Paul shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s difficult. My life&#x2019;s sort of weird, because of my father. Because of everything. Anyway, I&#x2019;m jealous of you getting out before me. Good luck.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>Paul hesitated a fraction longer, then left. Alex gazed thoughtfully at the empty doorway. Perhaps his father was some sort of politician or banker. On the few occasions they had spoken, he&#x2019;d gotten the impression that the other boy was friendless. He wondered how many kids were admitted into this hospital who had fathers willing to spend thousands to make them better, but who had no time to visit them while they were there.</p><p>It was nine o&#x2019;clock. Alex flicked through the television channels, but there was nothing on. He wished now that he had accepted the sleeping pill from the nurse. A little sip of water and he would have been out for the night. And out of the hospital the next day. Alex was looking forward to that more than anything. He needed to start his life again.</p><p>He watched half an hour of a comedy that didn&#x2019;t make him laugh. Then he switched off the television, turned off the light, and curled up in the bed one last time. He rather wished Diana Meacher had come back to see him. Briefly he remembered the scent of her perfume. And then he was asleep.</p><p>But not for long.</p><p>The next thing Alex knew, it was half past twelve. There was a clock beside the bed, its numerals glowing in the dark. He woke up reluctantly, trying to climb back down into the pit from which he had come. The truth was, it was difficult to sleep when he had done nothing to make him tired. All day he&#x2019;d been lying there, breathing in the clean, conditioned atmosphere that at St. Dominic&#x2019;s passed for air.</p><p>He lay in the semidarkness, wondering what to do. Then he got up and slipped into his dressing gown. This was the worst thing about being in the hospital. There was no way out, nowhere to go. Alex couldn&#x2019;t get used to it. Every night for a week, he&#x2019;d woken up at about the same time, and finally he&#x2019;d decided to break the rules and escape from the sterile box that was his room. He wanted to be outside. He needed the smell of London, the noise of the traffic, the feeling that he still belonged to the real world.</p><p>He put on a pair of slippers and went out. The lights had been dimmed, casting no more than a discreet glow outside his room. There was a computer screen gleaming behind the nurses&#x2019; station but no sign of Diana Meacher or any...</p></p><h2>The Lover</h2><p>The author� s first novel-a dreamlike story of a husband� s obsessive search for his wife� s lover amid the turbulence of the Yom Kippur War. � The story of the search has the elegant symmetry of a cut gem� (New Yorker).

Ghost World has become a cultural and generational touchstone, and continues to enthrall and inspire readers over a decade after its original release as a graphic novel. Originally serialized in the pages of the seminal comic book Eightball throughout the mid-1990s, this quasi-autobiographical story (the name of one of the protagonists is famously an anagram of the author&#39;s name) follows the adventures of two teenage girls, Enid and Becky, two best friends facing the prospect of growing up, and more importantly, apart. Daniel Clowes is one of the most respected cartoonists of his generation, and Ghost World is his magnum opus. Adapted into a major motion picture directed by Terry Zwigoff (director of the acclaimed documentary Crumb ), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. This graphic novel is a must for any self-respecting comics fan&#39;s library. Two-color comics throughout Dan Clowes described the story in Ghost World as the examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and (mostly) undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish. From this perch comes a revelation about adolescence that is both subtle and coolly beautiful. Critics have pointed out Clowes&#39;s cynicism and vicious social commentary, but if you concentrate on those aspects, you&#39;ll miss the exquisite whole that Clowes has captured. Each chapter ends with melancholia that builds towards the amazing, detached, ghostlike ending.</p><p>Dan Clowes described the story in <i>Ghost World</i> as the examination of "the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and (mostly) undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish."

From its beginning as a frui</p><p>Like his father before him, Frank Christian is a devoted Augusta watcher. Their family photos are a virtual who&#39;s who of golf greatness, and because the Christian name is high on the leader board of golf photographers, many of the shots that make up this scrapbook--the candids, the action shots, and the behind-the-scenes glimpses--are as classic as a Sneadapproach or a PlayerPlayer pitch. No single image ever captured the complexly patriarchal and patronizing spirit of Augusta National better than Christian&#39;s elaborate staging of club co-founder Clifford Roberts, a martinet of a man who once suggested that Easter should be postponed because it conflicted with the Masters&#39; final round. Roberts is captured apparently walking on water with his white-suited black caddie, waist-deep and sinking, toting Roberts&#39;s golf bag behind him. Masters devotees will doubtless find its inclusion alone worth the greens fees.The Masters has always been very special to me- and, it is wonderful to enjoy the history and tradition of this great tournament through the photos of Frank Christian. He's the best! - Jack Nicklaus <p>I've known Frank Christian since he was just a youngster, and met his father when I first played in the Augusta National Invitiational Tournament in 1935. I definitely believe that Frank is the best and fastest photographer I've ever seen. Frank's photographic record of Augusta National will add immeasurably to the history of the game of golf, and to the history of my favorite tournament- the Masters. -Byron Nelson </p><p>The Masters and the Augusta National Golf Club are two subjects very dear to my heart. Since I love the history of both, this book will provide those interested a unique perspective. - Ben Crenshaw </p><p>Frank Chistian certainly has played an important role in my golf career at the Masters, catching some of the most historic moments with his camera.

The bright 14-year-old was born with water on the brain, is regularly the target of bullies, and loves to draw. He says, "I think the world is a series of broken dams and floods, and my cartoons are tiny little lifeboats." He expects disaster when he transfers from the reservation school to the rich, white school in Reardan, but soon finds himself making friends with both geeky and popular students and starting on the basketball team. Meeting his old classmates on the court, Junior grapples with questions about what constitutes one's community, identity, and tribe. The daily struggles of reservation life and the tragic deaths of the protagonist's grandmother, dog, and older sister would be all but unbearable without the humor and resilience of spirit with which Junior faces the world. The many characters, on and off the rez, with whom he has dealings are portrayed with compassion and verve, particularly the adults in his extended family. Forney's simple pencil cartoons fit perfectly within the story and reflect the burgeoning artist within Junior. Reluctant readers can even skim the pictures and construct their own story based exclusively on Forney's illustrations. The teen's determination to both improve himself and overcome poverty, despite the handicaps of birth, circumstances, and race, delivers a positive message in a low-key manner. Alexie's tale of self-discovery is a first purchase for all libraries.&#x2014;<i>Chris Shoemaker, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Following the fall of mainland Europe, hostile Allied actions against land-based Axis forces were generally limited to air attacks. However, as the numbers of those attacks increased, the number of aircraft and crews failing to return grew alarmingly: something needed to be done to provide these air crews with aids to enable them to evade to safe territory or escape captivity, or losses of irreplaceable crews would become critical. Britain&#x2019;s MI-9 and U.S. MIS-X organizations were formed solely to support evaders and prisoners of war in occupied territories. They developed a wide variety of evasion and escape devices that were given to Allied Forces prior to operations in hostile territory or delivered clandestinely to POWs. It worked: the aids facilitated the return of thousands of men to their units.</p><p>Phil Froom served nine years in the British Army working globally in Signals Intelligence, before taking up a role in the defence industry.

Packed full of colour illustrations, maps and photos, it portrays every conceivable type of escape equipment, explaining who used them, how, why, when and where.

As my father in law was a member, having bailed out of his burning plane over Denmark, I was immediately hooked. With over 700 unique images of immensely rare devices, this is a fascinating book which covers the evolution, formation and role of the secret wartime organisation known as MI9 and its US mirror organisation MIS-X. These two organisations were responsible for the invention, production and distribution of a huge variety of ingenious evasion and escape devices issued to allied air crew and Special Operations personnel to enable them to evade capture after being forced down, or cut off behind enemy lines in occupied Europe, hopefully to evade and safely return to their Squadrons and Regiments to continue the struggle against Axis powers. The escape items featured include pens, pencils, razors, shaving brushes, tooth brushes, combs, cigarette lighters, books, mirrors, games, sporting goods, dart boards and numerous other everyday items, all constructed with escape devices concealed inside. - Antiques Diary May 2016 &#34;A lavishly illustrated, glossy and impressive publication which proved to be a thoroughly good read.&#34; - Armourer, issue 133 2016 The Mail Online featured an article: &#34;Revealed: The real-life James Bond gadgets invented by MI9 spies in WWII including compasses in dice and daggers in pens that were smuggled into PoW camps inside board games&#34; which includes several illustrations of the intriguing gadgets in this book - take a look at the link below!</p><h2>The New Pillsbury Family Cookbook</h2><p>By combining newly developed recipes with a collection of updated favorites, Pillsbury has created a full-color guide to the best in cooking, entertaining and economy that includes all the down-to-earth knowledge a cook needs.</p><p></p><h2>Penguin English Library the Old Curiosity Shop</h2><p>The Penguin English Library Edition of The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens &#39;But what added most to the grotesque expression of his face, was a ghastly smile, which, appearing to be the mere result of habit and to have no connexion with any mirthful or complacent feeling, constantly revealed the few discoloured fangs that were yet scattered in his mouth, and gave him the aspect of a panting dog&#39; The tale of Little Nell gripped the nation when it first appeared in 1841. Described as a &#39;tragedy of sorrows&#39;, the story tells of Nell uprooted from a secure and innocent childhood and cast into a world where evil takes many shapes, the most fascinating of which is the stunted, lecherous Quilp. Blending realism with non-realistic genres such as fairy-tale, allegory, and pastoral, the tale of Nell&#39;s tragedy contains some of Dickens most memorable comic and grotesque creations, including the dwarf Daniel Quilp, Dick Swiveller and Kit Nubbles. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>The sound of Little Nell clattering hurriedly over cobblestones immediately sets the stage by bringing to mind the narrow and dangerous streets of Victorian London. No fewer than 20 performers are called upon to conjure up the Dickensian world of wanderers, ne'er-do-wells, con artists, and kind Samaritans--and each performance is excellent. Tom Courtenay plays the sadistic Quilp, "the ugliest dwarf that could be seen anywhere for a penny" with magnificent sarcastic glee, and Teresa Gallagher's silvery, childlike voice is ideally suited for the role of the angelic Little Nell. <p> Nell is on her way home to the dusty shop where she and her grandfather live a rather mysterious life. The old man disappears every night--visiting gambling dens with the naive hope of winning a fortune. Instead he sinks deeper and deeper into debt. Enter Daniel Quilp, moneylender, who becomes furious upon learning that the grandfather is a pauper and will never be able to repay his tremendous debt. Quilp seizes the curiosity shop and begins making lecherous overtures to Nell, so she and her grandfather steal away one morning to seek their fortunes elsewhere. But the demonic dwarf is never far behind.</p> <p> Sound effects are employed judiciously and serve mainly as a springboard for the listener's imagination. The sound of a crying baby is enough to convey the image of crowded lodgings and genteel Victorian poverty, while raucous laughter and high-pitched squawks evoke the barely controlled chaos of an outdoor Punch and Judy show. The dramatization pares Dickens's weighty novel down to two and one-half hours, but does so skillfully, retaining Dickens's wit, marvelous dialogue, and delightful characterizations.

He flew 134 combat missions in Vietnam. Selected in the first group of space shuttle astronauts, he completed three space missions. He currently lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with his wife, Donna.With a testosterone-fueled swagger and a keen eye for particulars, Mullane takes readers into the high-intensity, high-stress world of the shuttle astronaut in this rough-hewn yet charming yarn of low-rent antics, bureaucratic insanity and transcendent beauty. Mullane opens this tale face down on a doctor's table awaiting a colorectal exam that will determine his fitness for astronaut training. "I was determined when the NASA proctologist looked up my ass, he would see pipes so dazzling he would ask the nurse to get his sunglasses," he writes, setting the tone for the crude and often hilarious story that follows. Chosen as a trainee in 1978, Mullane, a Vietnam vet, quickly finds himself at odds with the buttoned-up post-Apollo NASA world of scientists, technocrats and civilian astronauts he describes as "tree-huggers, dolphin friendly fish eaters, vegetarians, and subscribers to the <i>New York Times.</i>" He holds female astronauts in special disregard, though he later grudgingly acknowledges the achievement and heroism of both the civilians and women. The book hits its stride with Mullane's space adventures: a difficult takeoff, the shift into zero gravity, his first view of the Earth from space: "To say the view was overwhelmingly beautiful would be an insult to God." <i>(Feb. 14)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In her new house there is one door that opens onto a brick wall. At least, it does until one day the bricks are gone and Coraline finds herself stepping over the threshold into another house . . . a house that's just like hers.</p><p>At first things appear marvelous in this other house. The food is better. The toy box is filled with windup angels that flutter about, books whose pictures crawl and shimmer, and little dinosaur skulls that chatter their teeth. But there's another mother and another father&#x2014;and they want Coraline to be their little girl and stay with them forever. They want to <em>change</em> her and never let her go.</p><p>Other children are also trapped, as lost souls behind a mirror, and Coraline is their only hope. She will have to find a way to meet the other mother's challenge in order to save the lost children, her ordinary life, and herself. </p></p><p>Coraline lives with her preoccupied parents in part of a huge old house--a house so huge that other people live in it, too... round, old former actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and their aging Highland terriers ("We trod the boards, luvvy") and the mustachioed old man under the roof ("'The reason you cannot see the mouse circus,' said the man upstairs, 'is that the mice are not yet ready and rehearsed.'") Coraline contents herself for weeks with exploring the vast garden and grounds. But with a little rain she becomes bored--so bored that she begins to count everything blue (153), the windows (21), and the doors (14). And it is the 14th door that--sometimes blocked with a wall of bricks--opens up for Coraline into an entirely alternate universe. Now, if you're thinking fondly of <i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> or <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, you're on the wrong track. Neil Gaiman's <i>Coraline</i> is far darker, far stranger, playing on our deepest fears. And, like Roald Dahl's work, it is delicious. <p> What's on the other side of the door? A distorted-mirror world, containing presumably everything Coraline has ever dreamed of... people who pronounce her name correctly (not "Caroline"), delicious meals (not like her father's overblown "recipes"), an unusually pink and green bedroom (not like her dull one), and plenty of horrible (very un-boring) marvels, like a man made out of live rats. The creepiest part, however, is her mirrored parents, her "other mother" and her "other father"--people who look just like her own parents, but with big, shiny, black button eyes, paper-white skin... and a keen desire to keep her on <i>their</i> side of the door. To make creepy creepier, <i>Coraline</i> has been illustrated masterfully in scritchy, terrifying ink drawings by British mixed-media artist and Sandman cover illustrator Dave McKean. This delightful, funny, haunting, scary as heck, fairy-tale novel is about as fine as they come. Highly recommended.

It dominates our decision-making for the future, guides multi-billion-dollar investments, and shapes our responses to climate change, inequality, and other environmental and social challenges that define our times.</p> <p>Pity then, or more like disaster, that its fundamental ideas are centuries out of date yet are still taught in college courses worldwide and still used to address critical issues in government and business alike.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s why it is time, says renegade economist Kate Raworth, to revise our economic thinking for the 21st century. In <em>Doughnut Economics,</em> she sets out seven key ways to fundamentally reframe our understanding of what economics is and does. Along the way, she points out how we can break our addiction to growth; redesign money, finance, and business to be in service to people; and create economies that are regenerative and distributive by design.</p> <p>Named after the now-iconic &#x201c;doughnut&#x201d; image that Raworth first drew to depict a sweet spot of human prosperity (an image that appealed to the Occupy Movement, the United Nations, eco-activists, and business leaders alike), <em>Doughnut Economics</em> offers a radically new compass for guiding global development, government policy, and corporate strategy, and sets new standards for what economic success looks like.</p> <p>Raworth handpicks the best emergent ideas&#x2015;from ecological, behavioral, feminist, and institutional economics to complexity thinking and Earth-systems science&#x2015;to address this question: How can we turn economies that need to grow, whether or not they make us thrive, into economies that make us thrive, whether or not they grow?</p> <p>Simple, playful, and eloquent, <em>Doughnut Economics</em> offers game-changing analysis and inspiration for a new generation of economic thinkers.</p></p><p><p>Kate Raworth is a renegade economist focused on exploring the economic mindset needed to address the 21st century&#x2019;s social and ecological challenges. She is a senior visiting research associate and advisory board member at Oxford University&#x2019;s Environmental Change Institute and teaches in its masters program for Environmental Change and Management. She is also senior associate of the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership and a member of the Club of Rome.

His fiction set in the world of Vermont&#x2019;s fabled Northeast Kingdom chronicles the intertwining family histories of the natives, wanderers, outcasts, and others who settled in this ethereal place. In its obituary, <i>The New York Times</i> wrote, &#x201c;Mr. Mosher&#x2019;s fictional Kingdom County, Vt., became his New England version of Faulkner&#x2019;s Yoknapatawpha County.&#x201d;</p><p> In <i>Points North,</i> completed just weeks before his death, Mosher presents a brilliant, lovingly-evoked collection of stories that center around the Kinneson family, ranging over decades of their history in the Kingdom. From a loquacious itinerant preacher who beguiles the reticent farmers and shopkeepers of a small New England town, to a proposed dam that threatens the river that Kinneson men have fished for generations, the scandalous secret of a romance and its violent consequences, and a young man&#x2019;s seemingly fruitless search for love&#x2015;<i>Points North</i> is a full-hearted, gently-comic, and beautifully-written last gift to the readers who treasure Howard Frank Mosher.</p></p><p>HOWARD FRANK MOSHER was the author of thirteen previous books of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>God's Kingdom</i>. He received Guggenheim and National Endowment for the Arts fellowships, the American Academy of Arts and Letters Literature Award, the New England Book Award, and the 2011 New England Independent Booksellers Association&#x2019;s President&#x2019;s Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Arts. In January 2017, Mosher passed away at the age of seventy-four in Vermont.<p>&#x201c;How bittersweet these last, wonderful <i>Points North</i> stories are, and how they intensify the loss of Howard Frank Mosher, one of our most beloved and sure-footed storytellers. One last time then, back to Kingdom County, the now mythic landscape that Howard made inseparable from those who lived there, the Kinnesons and Pliny Templeton, and all the rest who filled and broke our hearts. Back one last time with the man who gave these people and this place such rich, abundant, glorious life.&#x201d; &#x2015;Richard Russo</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Points North</i> will be our final visit to Howard Frank Mosher's beloved northeast corner of Vermont, a remote swath of land he christened Kingdom County. But like Mosher himself, this book's moral compass is spot-on, the characters eccentric and original, the stories ranging from heartbreaking to hilarious. This book is a gift: Mosher saved the best for last.&#x201d; &#x2015;Chris Bohjalian, author of <i>The Sleepwalker</i> and <i>The Guest Room</i><br><i></i><br>&#x201c;This splendid collection from Howard Frank Mosher shows his signature narrative gifts....The lives of the Kinneson family, in all of their hardscrabble joys, sorrows, and romantic scandals, compose wonderful rural dramas.

Mosher elevates literature to that high a level of regard.&#x201d; &#x2015;Howard Norman, author of <i>The Bird Artist</i> and <i>Next Life Might Be Kinder</i></p><p>"What a gift Howard Frank Mosher has left us. <i>Points North </i>is beautiful, smart, poignant, and funny, all written in the inimitable voice of one of America&#x2019;s greatest storytellers." &#x2015;Thomas Christopher Greene, author of <i>If I Forget You</i> and <i>The Headmaster's Wife</i></p><p>"There's a delightful circularity and gemlike clarity to Howard Frank Mosher's final gift to American letters. The stories in <i>Points North</i> allow us the opportunity to revisit some of his most treasured characters, filling us in on different events in their lives, and in some cases, their deaths. It is his ability to depict humanity in full, with laughter, guile, and duplicity, often not separated by more than a blink. A stunning, and for many of us, heartbreaking, culmination for one of the most unique of American writers." &#x2015;Jeffrey Lent, author of <i>In the Fall </i>and <i>Before We Sleep</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"Deceptive in their simplicity, Mosher&#x2019;s stories poignantly illuminate complex themes of loyalty and identity and can rightfully be called American classics." - <i>Booklist</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"Mosher&#x2019;s lyrical stories, published posthumously, stand as a last testament to his place among the best regional American writers of his day...Mosher&#x2019;s rich language makes art from both history and the quotidian, from bigotry and courage to fishing flies and brook trout." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"With elegant prose Mosher skillfully creates characters of depth and interest, filling his stories with gentle humor and emphasizing the ties that make and preserve family history...Recommended." -<i> Library Journal</i><br><i></i></p></p><h2>Final Analysis: The Making And Unmaking Of A Psychoanalyst</h2><p>The former Projects Director of the Sigmund Freud Archives exposes psychoanalytic training as a bizarre, inequitable socialization process and reveals what the gurus of psychoanalysis are really like</p><p><b>More praise for Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson<br>and <i>Final Analysis</i><br></b><br>&#x201c;For all the light Masson sheds once again on the Freudians, this is most of all a fascinating and highly unusual kind of autobiography&#x2013;a truthful account of the subject&#x2019;s own professional training&#x2013;a side of life we hardly ever hear about.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;KATE MILLETT<br><br>&#x201c;Even if only a fraction of psychoanalysts and analysands have suffered experience quite so gross as that revealed by Jeffrey Masson, his candid and fascinating account of his unique trajectory through the world of psychoanalysis should cause widespread soul-searching on the real value of years spent on or behind the couch.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;DOUG ELLSBERG<br><br>&#x201c;A powerful volume which&#x2013;along with his other books&#x2013;must be read by all mental-health professionals because of Masson&#x2019;s passionate insistence that we confront the social realities, the value systems, and the arbitrary abuse of power in actual life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;DR.

And then Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson threw it all away because he dared to break the psychoanalytic community&#x2019;s deepest taboo: he told the truth in public. As he unmasks the pretensions and abuses of this elite profession, Masson invites us to eavesdrop on the shockingly unorthodox analysis he was subjected to in the course of his analytic training. But the more prestige Masson attained, the more he came to doubt not only the integrity of his colleagues, but the validity of their method. In the end, he blew the whistle&#x2013;fully aware of the personal and professional consequences.<br><br>With wit, wonder, and unflinching candor, Masson brilliantly exposes the cult of psychoanalysis and recounts his own self-propelled fall from grace. A sensation when it first appeared, <i>Final Analysis </i>is even more provocative and engrossing today. Written with passion and humor, this is the book that revealed a revered profession for what it was&#x2013;and launched Masson on his true career.</p><h2>DESERT SOLITAIRE</h2><p>1978 Edition.

Even as the Civil War remade their world, these earliest readers wrestled with Darwin&#x2019;s ideas: some doubted, many accepted (more or less), and a few&#x2014;like Thoreau&#x2014;embraced the beauty of Darwin&#x2019;s view of life. Fuller shows how ideas come to life, shaped by chance meetings, life-changing enthusiasms, perverse misunderstandings, cataclysmic events, and sudden betrayals.

It provides fresh, unpublished information on all aspects of Morgan&#39;s life and furnishes a new perspective on the Civil War. In a highly original interpretation, Ramage portrays Morgan as a revolutionary guerrilla chief. Using the tactics of guerrilla war and making his own rules, Morgan terrorized federal provost marshals in an independent campaign to protect Confederate sympathizers in Kentucky. He killed pickets and used the enemy uniform as a disguise, frequently masquerading as a Union officer. Employing civilians in the fighting, he set off a cycle of escalating violence which culminated in an unauthorized policy of retaliation by his command on the property of Union civilians. To many southerners, Morgan became the prime model of a popular movement for guerrilla warfare that led to the Partisan Ranger Act. For Confederates he was the ideal romantic cavalier, the &#34;Francis Marion of the War,&#34; and they make him a folk hero who was especially adored by women. Discerning fact from folklore, Ramage describes Morgan&#39;s strengths and weaknesses and suggests that excessive dependence on his war bride contributed to his declining success. The author throws new light on the Indiana-Ohio Raid and the suspenseful escape from the Ohio Penitentiary and unravels the mysteries around Morgan&#39;s death in Greeneville, Tennessee. Rebel Raider also shows how in the popular mind John Hunt Morgan was deified as a symbol of the Lost Cause.</p><p>&#39;A stimulating work, a model of how deep research and fresh insight can breathe new life into the much-cultivated field of Civil War history.... Ramage achieves a new appreciation of Morgan&#39;s military significance by placing his activities in the context of classic guerrilla warfare.&#39;--Civil War HistoryJames A.

Building on much recent research Janet Macdonald shows how the sailor&#39;s official diet was better than he was likely to enjoy ashore, and of ample calorific value for his highly active shipboard life. When trouble flared and food was a major grievance in the great mutinies of 1797 the usual reason was the abuse of the system. This system was an amazing achievement. At the height of the Napoleonic Wars the Royal Navy&#39;s administrators fed a fleet of more than 100,000 men, in ships that often spent months on end at sea. Despite the difficulty of preserving food before the advent of refrigeration and meat-canning, the British fleet had largely eradicated scurvy and other dietary disorders by 1800. This was the responsibility of the Victualling Board, a much-maligned but generally efficient bureaucracy that organized the preparing and packing of meat, the brewing of beer, the baking of ship&#39;s biscuit, and all the logistics of the Navy and on an industrial scale unparalleled elsewhere. Once aboard ship food and drink was subject to stringent controls to ensure fairness, and this book takes a fresh look at the tarnished reputations of Purser and Cook, before turning to the ways both officers and men were able to supplement their official rations, including the keeping of livestock on board. A chapter compares provisions in the other major navies of the time, and the book concludes with recipes for some of the exotic sounding dishes, like lobscouse, prepared by naval cooks. While Feeding Nelson&#39;s Navy contains much of value to the historian, it is written with a popular touch that will enthral anyone with an interest in life at sea in the age of sail.</p><p>JANET MACDONALD has written a number of books on cookery subjects, and this one is based on her current research into naval victualling for a higher degree at the Greenwich Maritime Institute. She was recently a featured historian on BBC4&#39;s Food At Sea programme.</p><h2>Fashion Statements: Interviews with Fashion Designers</h2><p>In this book Francesca Alfano Miglietti offers a collection of everything that has created scandal, enthusiasm, excitement and a sense of participation in fashion, and examines the construction and de-construction of our bodies and our identities, beginning with what we wear and the relationship our clothes have with all that is contemporary.

They released him, not realizing he was a pilot in the RAF volunteer reserve: and the rest is history. Eric Brown joined the Fleet Air Arm and went on to be the greatest test pilot in history, flying more different aircraft types than anyone else. Today, at 87, he is in great demand for interviews on history TV documentaries (twelve in 2005!). He is the only man alive who has flown every major (and most minor) combat aircraft of the Second World War as well as all the early jets. Speaking perfect German, he went to Germany in 1945 to test the Nazi jets, interviewing (among others) Hermann Goering and Hanna Reitsch. He flew the suicidally dangerous Me 163 rocket plane, and tested the first British jets. He would have been the first man to break the sound barrier, except that the British government cancelled the programme and gave the technology to America. His naval career continues to this day, as he advises on the new aircraft carrier design for the Royal Navy. A living legend among aviation enthusiasts, his amazing life story deserves to be told in full -- from crashing in front of Winston Churchill to unmasking a Neo-Nazi ring in the 1950s to his terrifying flights in primitive jets and rockets.</p><p>Eric Brown is in the Guinness Book of Records for having flown more aircraft types (487) than any other pilot in the world. His record is unlikely to be broken, ever.

Analyst Dr. Frederick Starks has just turned 53 and, on his birthday, receives a letter informing him that he has ruined the letter-writer's life and now his own life is about to be ruined.<p> Starks must solve a riddle, he is told. He must find out whose life he ruined within two weeks. If he does not, he must kill himself. If he does not kill himself, then those nearest and dearest to him will be killed. The letter is signed, Rumpelstiltskin. At first Starks is dismissive--but he does call relatives to see that they are all right. Not all of them are. In fact Starks is convinced that the letter writer is deadly serious when he discovers how the birthday of his 14-year-old great-niece was ruined. He must now engage in the game or be responsible for the lives of others.</p><p> While he works frantically to try and unlock the past and find whose life he could possibly have ruined, Rumpelstiltskin is also busy. Within hours of receiving that first shattering letter, one of Dr. Starks's patients throws himself under a subway train, though Starks knows the patient was not suicidal. </p><p> When the police tell him that a couple and a homeless woman saw the man jump, Starks tries to find them. He finds only the homeless woman, who tells him that she was given money by the couple to tell what she witnessed. Starks is certain that Rumpelstiltskin must be one of the couple, but he's wrong. It's even more sinister than that, and when he meets the accomplices, he realizes that his adversary has been planning his revenge for years.</p><p> Soon, Starks's life is spiraling downward. There is nothing hidden from Rumpelstiltskin. His credit cards, his bank accounts, his patients, his homes in Manhattan and in Massachusetts, his reputation--nothing and no one is safe as Starks races against time as his world shrinks and his options run out. The clock is ticking as he hunts a ruthless psychopath who always seems to be one step ahead of him. As Starks tries to figure out what to do besides react to his life spinning out of control, he uses his training, his dwindling resources, and every weapon available to him to combat this relentless and deadly foe. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p><b>John Katzenbach</b> has written seven previous novels: the Edgar Award-nominated <i>In the Heat of the Summer</i>, which was adapted for the screen as <i>The Mean Season</i>; the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Traveler</i>; <i>Day of Reckoning</i>; <i>Just Cause</i>, which was also made into a movie; <i>The Shadow Man</i> (another Edgar nominee); <i>State of Mind, </i>and <i>Hart&#x2019;s War</i>.

In my defense, half a dozen people at that same meeting chimed in. &#x201c;Get in line&#x201d; or &#x201c;join the club&#x201d; or &#x201c;you and me both.&#x201d; </p><p>It was a figure of speech, and everyone in the room&#x2014;twenty-five northern Virginia winemakers like me&#x2014;knew it. At least that&#x2019;s what I thought at the time. So when I found Paul hanging from a beam a few weeks later in the old fieldstone barn he&#x2019;d converted into an artist&#x2019;s studio, the first thing I thought was, &#x201c;Oh, my God, someone really did it.&#x201d; </p><p>My second thought was that I could see my breath because the room felt like I&#x2019;d stepped inside a refrigerator, which was odd on a sweltering July day. A blast of arctic air blew down my spine, bringing with it the faint but unmistakable sickening-sweet stench of death. How long had he been here? A few hours&#x2014;maybe more&#x2014; based on his mottled face, bugged-out, vacant eyes, and the slightly blackened tongue protruding from his mouth. I put a hand over my own mouth, swallowing what had come up in my throat. At least the glacial temperature had slowed down decomposition. </p><p>A paint-spattered stool was overturned in a wet spot on the carpet underneath Paul. He&#x2019;d soiled himself&#x2014;his khakis were stained&#x2014;but the rug was damp from something else. An empty bottle of wine lay on the rug on its side next to a broken wineglass. I didn&#x2019;t need to lean in to see what he had been drinking. A bottle of my vineyard&#x2019;s wine, Montgomery Estate Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc. We&#x2019;d won a couple of awards for it. </p><p>It was still possible to make out something in faded gold silk-screen on the wineglass. Nothing I recognized. No logo, no fancy calligraphy of a vineyard&#x2019;s name or a commemorative occasion, just a cartoonish figure of an empty-eyed man whose hands were clasped over stubs of ears, mouth open in the perfect round O of a scream. </p><p>My stomach churned again. I reached out to steady myself on the glass-topped table Paul used for his tubes of paint, palettes, and jars of brushes, pulling my hand back in the nick of time. The Loudoun County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department would be all over this place as soon as someone&#x2014;meaning me&#x2014;phoned in a suspicious death, and they&#x2019;d check for fingerprints, fibers, and whatever they could find that would tell them who Paul&#x2019;s most recent visitors had been. No point contributing evidence I&#x2019;d have to explain later. </p><p>I backed out of the barn into a wall of triple-digit heat. Though Paul had made many enemies with the way he did business, that kicked-over stool looked like suicide. Talk about an unlikely person to kill himself. Only two days ago I&#x2019;d been on the phone with him and he&#x2019;d been as ornery and mean-spirited as ever. </p><p>The only remaining brother of Noble Brothers Fine Wine Importers and Distributors, Paul Noble had the exclusive contract to distribute my wines to restaurants and stores, a monopoly he ran like a tin-pot dictator and the reason so many vineyard owners hated him. If you wanted your wine sold anywhere outside your tasting room, it worked like this: Paul told you what he&#x2019;d pay for it, and you said okay. Tell him no or &#x201c;if you think I&#x2019;m giving it to you for that price, you&#x2019;re out of your mind,&#x201d; and no one else would, or could, buy it. Hence the word &#x201c;exclusive&#x201d; and the reason he got away with rock-bottom offers that forced more than one small family-owned vineyard to throw in the towel after their profit margin flatlined. </p><p>These were hardworking people&#x2014;friends, not some faceless business ventures. Paul was nothing more than a wholesaler middleman who pocketed a share of someone else&#x2019;s blood, sweat, and toil. For that we could thank the Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution, which repealed Prohibition but kept a choke hold over the distribution of &#x201c;demon alcohol,&#x201d; spawning the Paul Nobles of this world. It wasn&#x2019;t fair, but it was the law. </p><p>Paul had called me two days ago. A Tuesday. The minute I saw his name flash on my phone&#x2019;s caller ID display, I knew I was in for it. He didn&#x2019;t waste any time telling me he could no longer buy my Cabernet Sauvignon for the price we&#x2019;d agreed in the spring, and if I wanted him to take it now, I had to throw in my Sauvignon Blanc, medals and all, for another fire sale price. </p><p>&#x201c;We had a deal,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You promised.&#x201d; </p><p>He&#x2019;d caught me as I was walking through the courtyard that connected the barrel room where we made wine with the tasting room where we sold it. In the distance, the vineyard was summer-lush and green, framed by the soft-shouldered Blue Ridge Mountains. I loved this view, especially at sunset when the honey-colored light spread across the fields and gilded the vines like a scene out of a dream. </p><p>&#x201c;Look, Lucie, it&#x2019;s not my fault the economy&#x2019;s in the toilet,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t sell it if I buy it at that price now.&#x201d; </p><p>I deadheaded flowers in a wine barrel planter filled with rioting petunias and variegated ivy, snapping off wilted blossoms and thinking evil thoughts about Paul. He could keep our agreement and sell it at the old price, but it meant cutting his own profit. </p><p>&#x201c;Paul,&#x201d; I said. <i>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d;</i> </p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, kiddo. No can do.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even cover my costs if I sell it to you for that price.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just for now,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Things&#x2019;ll improve and we&#x2019;ll do better next year. We all have to tighten our belts, you know.&#x201d; </p><p>Paul&#x2019;s belt went around a waistline that was forty-plus inches. He flew to Europe regularly to negotiate deals on the wines he imported, where he also bought his handmade shirts on Jermyn Street and his bespoke tailored suits on Savile Row in London, his favorite tasseled loafers at Gucci in Rome, and his silk bow ties from haute-couture designers in Paris. </p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we can talk about this,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Sweetheart, come on. I&#x2019;m trying to help you here.&#x201d; He sucked air through the straw of whatever he was drinking. A perfect metaphor for our conversation and the way I felt. &#x201c;You know as well as I do that unless you meet my price, your wine will just sit in the warehouse. No one will touch it. They&#x2019;ll buy something else.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true.&#x201d; I rubbed a small spot between my eyes where my pulse had started to pound. </p><p>I knew this game. He muscled me to cut my profit and then he did the same thing to the retailer. Everybody bled but him. </p><p>&#x201c;Look, I gotta go. Someone just walked in. Think it over. You&#x2019;ve got two days.&#x201d; He hung up before I could make a stunned reply. </p><p>One of the threadbare jokes about owning a vineyard is that it&#x2019;s a surefire way to make a small fortune: all you have to do is start with a large one. I didn&#x2019;t have a large fortune when I took over the family business four years ago, thanks to Leland, my father, who never met an investment opportunity&#x2014;or get-rich-quick scheme&#x2014;that hadn&#x2019;t called out to him and his wallet until he died in a hunting accident. After his death, an inheritance from my mother&#x2019;s estate helped me get back on my feet, but that money was gone after fixing what Leland had let get run down and planting more vines. Throw in a rough spring earlier this year when my winemaker took a break to wrap up personal business in California, and an unexpected hard frost in May that killed half our crop, and I was teetering on the precipice again. Paul&#x2019;s phone call couldn&#x2019;t have come at a worse time. </p><p>For the next forty-eight hours I&#x2019;d stewed about that ultimatum and the unfairness of what he was trying to do to me. Finally I decided to drive over to his home outside the pretty Quaker village of Waterford, rather than meet him in his Georgetown office, and tell him to go to hell. That was before I discovered him hanging from a rafter in his barn above a pool of my Sauvignon Blanc. </p><p>I shaded my eyes against the hard slant of the noontime sunshine and looked across Paul&#x2019;s golf-course-perfect lawn to the fields and woods beyond. The main road was a half mile away at the end of his long driveway&#x2014;more like a private road. A car could have come and gone easily without being noticed, certainly not by any neighbor since the nearest one was down the road apiece. The only vehicle I&#x2019;d seen after driving through the tree-lined streets of Waterford had been a John Deere tractor on the outskirts of town. The farmer pulled over and waved so I could pass him near the cemetery entrance on Loyalty Road. </p><p>Had someone else come by earlier, before I got here? What if he&#x2014;or she, or they&#x2014;killed Paul and then staged the hanging so a murder looked like suicide? And what if they were still here, waiting? Was I alone now? </p><p>I shuddered and took a long, slow look around the house and grounds. Except for the twittering of birds hidden in the trees and the faint buzz of the cicadas, the place was as hushed and silent as a cathedral. </p><p>I pulled my phone out of my purse. Once I called the sheriff&#x2019;s department, I&#x2019;d be halfway down the slippery slope, letting myself in for a heap of trouble. First, I was the one who found Paul. Then there was that argument we had the last time we spoke and the fact that I recently said in public that I&#x2019;d like to kill him&#x2014;even if it was in jest. Throw in my wine bottle at the scene and the reason I&#x2019;d come over here unannounced: to have a showdown with the deceased. </p><p>On the plus side, I didn&#x2019;t murder Paul Noble. </p><p>I punched in 911 on my phone and made the call. </p><p>� 2011 Ellen Crosby </p></p><h2>Thrushes</h2><p>This book is devoted to the 162 species of thrush, one of the most widespread and well-known families of birds in the world.

And one of the most beautiful sights in the history of baseball was Hank Greenberg's swing. His calmly poised body seemed to have some special set of springs with a trigger release that snapped his arms and swept the bat through the air with the clean speed and strength of a propeller. But what is even more extraordinary than his grace and his power is that in Detroit of 1934, his swing&#x2014;or its absence&#x2014;became entwined with American Jewish history. Though Hank Greenberg was one of the first players to challenge Babe Ruth's single-season record of sixty home runs, it was the game Greenberg did not play for which he is best remembered. With his decision to sit out a 1934 game between his Tigers and the New York Yankees because it fell on Yom Kippur, Hank Greenberg became a hero to Jews throughout America. Yet, as Kurlansky writes, he was the quintessential secular Jew, and to celebrate him for his loyalty to religious observance is to ignore who this man was.</p><p>In <i>Hank Greenberg</i> Mark Kurlansky explores the truth behind the slugger's legend: his Bronx boyhood, his spectacular discipline as an aspiring ballplayer, the complexity of his decision not to play on Yom Kippur, and the cultural context of virulent anti-Semitism in which his career played out.</p><p>What Kurlansky discovers is a man of immense dignity and restraint with a passion for sport who became a great reader&#x2014;a man, too, who was an inspiration to the young Jackie Robinson, who&nbsp;said, "Class tells.

However, the seeds for this book were sown in my own health crisis. Like 23.5 million other Americans, I suffer from autoimmune disease, and it has ravaged my life, placing before me the greatest obstacles I have ever known. Pages of this book were written during different stays in the small white hospital rooms of Johns Hopkins Hospital, and many chapters were drafted during long bedridden months at home.</p><p>The greatest of these challenges began one fine spring afternoon as I was celebrating "Carpet Day" with my daughter. Carpet Day is our own personal mother-child holiday, celebrated only by us. On the first great spring day we take an old carpet and unroll it on our suburban drive. We bring pillows, chalk, snacks, and lemonade and lie there, reading and chatting, pretending it's the beach for a whole afternoon. On Carpet Day, you can almost hear the seagulls and feel the breeze from the ocean waves that we still won't visit for months. That day, we brought our golden retriever puppy outside with us. He saw a squirrel, and off he went. I bounded after him, or tried to, only to find that my left leg wouldn't follow my right. I hurtled headlong into the grass.</p><p>Over the next seventy-two hours, my left leg, then my right, then both arms lost all muscle control as my body underwent what was -- for me -- the all-too-familiar creeping paralysis of Guillain-Barr� syndrome, an autoimmune illness in which the nerve's myelin sheaths are destroyed by the body's own immune system.</p><p>Guillain-Barr� syndrome, or GBS, usually attacks a month or so after a patient has had a common viral or bacterial infection. Just three weeks earlier, I had had a stomach bug. My body's immune fighter cells had mounted a war to eliminate those germs, but once they'd achieved that goal, instead of ceasing their attack they turned on my own body -- in a deadly game of self-sabotage. With Guillain-Barr�, the immune system gets its wires dangerously crossed and while trying to fight off the infectious agent also damages the myelin sheaths that wrap around all of our nerves like a protective insulation. The damage is so rapid that a patient's myelin sheaths and the axonal nerves they protect can be methodically and painfully stripped away -- leaving them entirely paralyzed within weeks, or even days.</p><p>It was the second time in four years that I had been paralyzed with GBS. Once before, in the spring of 2001, when my son was six and my daughter two, I had developed this same bizarre and devastating disease after a stomach bug. In 2001, physicians at the local emergency room confidently misdiagnosed my leg weakness and back pain as a back injury and prescribed bed rest. But instead of improving with rest, I lost nerve and muscle control in my legs by steady degrees over a period of nearly two weeks. One day I could stand on my toes, a few days later I couldn't quite manage it. A few days after that I couldn't flex my feet. A week later, I would stand up and try not to crash into the wall, but suddenly the wall would be there to greet me.</p><p>A day or two later, I attempted to get to my two-year-old after she bloodied her toe by stubbing it on the leg of my dresser, but I couldn't make it there, even on my knees. The communiqu�s my brain sent to my body to feel the floor beneath my feet simply didn't connect.</p><p>One afternoon my son, then six, tried to rouse me by showing me how competent he'd become overnight at tying his shoes, as if by some magical power he could banish his mom's bizarre inability to budge from bed.</p><p>"Look, Mom!" he called to me from downstairs, near the front door where we kept our shoes. "I tied my shoes! On my <i>own!</i>" There was a moment's pause, and then -- making a decision to ignore the no-shoes-in-the-house rule -- he clambered up the stairs to show me his handiwork, pride widening his smile.</p><p>"<i>Great</i> job, buddy." I tousled his hair and smiled back, ignoring the sneaker prints trailing behind him across the bedroom rug.</p><p>"Mom?" he asked, his tone uncertain. "Can you help me tighten the loops?" He put his foot up on the side of the bed. I tried to pull at both laces to make the floppy loops smaller but my fingers weren't strong enough.</p><p>"I can't manage it at the moment, buddy," I said. His face grew ashen and tight. I tried to comfort him, repeating a made-up acronym I sometimes used to soothe my children, hoping it would do the trick again. "Remember? My love for you is very FINE -- it is Forever, Infinite, Neverending, and <i>Everywhere</i> you go." We lay side by side, my words all I had to embrace him with as I struggled to hide my own panic. Why was I losing muscle control in my arms as well as my legs?</p><p>Within twenty-four hours, my breathing became shallow and short. It was clear I was facing something other than a back problem. I was admitted to Hopkins, where the neurologist who took my case ordered infusions of immunoglobulin, or other people's healthy immune cells, the standard treatment for GBS. In many first-time cases, but not all, GBS paralysis is 90-percent reversible with treatment, and the myelin sheaths begin to regenerate. It is a remarkable process. If left untreated, GBS can be fatal; the paralysis spreads to the lungs, and patients require intubation -- a tube inserted into the airway to prevent them from suffocating to death. In 2001, I recovered well with immunoglobulin treatments followed by months of physical therapy. Although I was left with strange neurological bells and whistles -- jingly nerve endings, tired, locked muscles, twitchy connections -- it seemed a minuscule price to pay for being able to walk unassisted again.</p><p>I was so very fortunate.</p><p>Still, other problems emerged. I was told that I also had leucopenia, a dangerously low white blood cell count. Leucopenia and GBS came on the heels of two earlier autoimmune diagnoses that had spanned the previous fifteen years. Small-fiber sensory neuropathy, which leads to a permanent loss of some of the normal sensation in the hands and feet, and hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid. In addition, I suffered from vasovagal syncope, a fainting and seizure disorder caused by the heart sending incorrect signals from the brain to the vagus nerve and failing to pump enough blood through the body, "cured" by doctors surgically implanting a pacemaker when I was twenty-eight.</p><p>Still, when Guillain-Barr� struck a second time in April 2005, it came as a devastating shock. You simply were not supposed to get GBS twice. If you did, your chances of regenerating your nerves went from 90 percent to -- well, no one quite knew. Toward the end of my hospital stay in the rehabilitation center, my physical medicine specialist stood at my bedside one day, patting my leg. "You might not get any better than you are right now," she warned, her voice soft for the blow. "But that doesn't mean you should give up hope."</p><p>I had no intention of giving up hope. As a child, I had watched my father suffer through a constellation of what I have since learned were autoimmune illnesses: inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and leucopenia. By the time my father was forty-two years old, he could barely walk a step without wincing with joint pain, and his bowels were continually inflamed. He died without warning one August morning following routine abdominal surgery to remove inflamed parts of his duodenum. I was twelve. It turned out that the heavy steroids his rheumatologist had prescribed for his arthritis had eaten through the sutures his stomach surgeon had sewn in, and the peritonitis that ensued caused his body to go into shock and his heart to arrest. "Normal courses of antibiotics proved unsuccessful," read his death report.</p><p>We knew so little then. Still, thirty years later, when my own frightening journey through autoimmune disease began, it seemed to me that we knew little more than we had in my father's era.</p><p>As I lay on that hospital bed with Guillain-Barr� for a second time in 2005, I couldn't help but compare my father's odyssey to my own. Like him, it seemed I possessed an irrationally overexuberant immune system. I lay in a hospital bed in the same medical institution, Johns Hopkins, one ward over from where my father had died from autoimmune-related complications at almost the very same age I was now. With a young son and daughter at home yet to raise, the similarities terrified me.</p><p>Back home, physical therapy, meditation, and an autoimmune-preventive diet all helped to bring incremental gains in mobility. I would later come to think of that time as a five-month journey around my room, often accompanied by my physical therapist at my side, as I sweated to graduate from wheelchair to walker to cane -- with no guarantee that I would improve. As one doctor explained, "You've had several forest fires, and each time it's harder and harder to get healthy regrowth." It was the second time in four years that my work as a journalist came to a sudden halt. Deadline after deadline passed. I was simply too weak to sit in front of a computer, let alone tap out words on the keyboard. I tried to get to the bathroom one night on my own, using my walker, without waking my husband to help steady me, but misjudged my stamina. On the way back I crashed into a window and fell in a heap on the floor, unable to get up on so much as one elbow. When you hear the phrase "and he scraped her up off the floor" and wonder what that really means, it means exactly what my husband did that night. He sat up and called my name out in confusion: where were my cries coming from? When he found me beneath the window he picked me up and laid me back in bed. We lay side by side, both too close to tears to risk words.</p><p>A few moments later, our son, ten then, crept silently into our room, having heard the commotion. He laid his head down in the dark beside me, his arm circling my waist from behind.</p><p>"Mom?" he said, his voice questioning, as he grasped my hand.</p><p>I tried to hide my wet eyes and clear my voice.</p><p>He pressed his face into the back o...</p></p><h2>Ray&#39;s a Laugh</h2><p>This book is about my close family.

Mencken</h2><p>A Historical Treasure: the never-before, published diary of the most outspoken, iconoclastic, ferociously articulate of American social critics -- the sui generis newspaperman, columnist for the Baltimore Sun, editor of The American Mercury, and author of The American Language, who was admired, feared, and famous for his merciless puncturing of smugness, his genius for deflating pomposity and pretense, his polemical brilliance. Walter Lippmann called him, in 1926, "the most powerful personal influence on this whole generation of educated Americans."<br><br>H. L. Mencken's diary was, at his own request, kept sealed in the vaults of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Library for a quarter of a century after his death. The diary covers the years 1930 -- 1948, and provides a vivid, unvarnished, sometimes shocking picture of Mencken himself, his world, and his friends and antagonists, from Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, and William Faulkner to Franklin D. Roosevelt, for whom Mencken nourished a hatred that resulted in spectacular and celebrated feats of invective.<br><br>From the more than 2,000 pages of typescript that have now come to light, the Mencken scholar Charles A. Fecher has made a generous selection of entries carefully chosen to preserve the whole range, color, and impact of the diary. Here, full scale, is Mencken the unique observer and disturber of American society. And here too is Mencken the human being of wildly contradictory impulses: the skeptic who was prey to small superstitions, the dare-all warrior who was a hopeless hypochondriac, the loving husband and generous friend who was, alas, a bigot.<br><br>Mencken emerges from these pages unretouched -- in all the often outrageous gadfly vitality that made him, at his brilliant best, so important to the intellectual fabric of American life.</p><p>About H. L. Mencken<p>"If Mencken had never lived, it would have taken a whole army of assorted philosophers, monologists, editors and patrons of the new writing to make up for him. As it was, he not only rallied all the young writers together and imposed his skepticism upon the new generation, but also brought a new and uproarious gift for high comedy into a literature that had never been too quick to laugh."</p><p>Alfred Kazin</p><p>"Mencken came in like a lion. Like a revolutionary, overthrowing half the props that supported America's conception of itself -- and not merely its beliefs and moralities, but its peace of mind."</p><p>Louis kronenberger</p><p>"He was vastly underrated as a humorist with one deadly sensible eye on the behavior of the human animal. He was, in fact, a humorist by instinct and a superb craftsman by temperament."</p><p>Alistair Cooke</p>Henry L. Mencken was born in Baltimore in 1880 and died there in 1956. He began his long career as a journalist, critic, and philologist on the Baltimore Morning Herald in 1899. In 1906 he joined the staff of the Baltimore Sun, thus beginning an association which lasted until a few years before his death. He was co-editor of the Smart Set with George Jean Nathan from 1908 to 1923, and with Nathan he founded The American Mercury, of which he was sole editor from 1925 to 1933. He was the author of many books, most notably The American Language, Prejudices, Happy Days, Newspaper Days, Heathen Days, and Minority Report.<br><br>Charles A. Fecher was born in Baltimore in 1917 and lives there still. He is the author of The Philosophy of Jacques Maritain and Mencken: A Study of His Thought. He has written articles and reviews for a large number of publications, including The Critic, The Catholic World, The Sign, and the Baltimore Sun.</p><h2>Texas-Israeli War: 1999</h2><p>The Texas-Israeli War: 1999 by Jake Saunders and Howard Waldrop</p><p></p><h2>Noisy Nora</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization, and helped make us who we are.</p><p>"A spectre is haunting Europe," Karl Marx and Frederic Engels wrote in 1848, "the spectre of Communism." This new edition of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the <i>Manifesto</i>'s vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles."A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism." So begins one of history's most important documents, a work of such magnitude that it has forever changed not only the scope of world politics, but indeed the course of human civilization. The Communist Manifesto was written in Friedrich Engels's clear, striking prose and declared the earth-shaking ideas of Karl Marx. Upon publication in 1848, it quickly became the credo of the poor and oppressed who longed for a society "in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." <br>The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy, which continues to inspire influential economic, political, social, and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document, one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe. <br>This Bantam Classic edition of The Communist Manifesto includes Marx and Engels's historic 1872 and 1882 prefaces, and Engels's notes and prefaces to the 1883 and 1888 editions.</p><h2>INTIMATE HISTORY OF HUMANITY</h2><p>Intimate History of Humanity</p><p>This groundbreaking book by an internationally renowned historian and prolific author is so wide-ranging in scope that categorizing the various issues and audiences it seeks to address would be difficult. Implicit in Zeldin's work is a challenge to traditional historians who have heretofore pigeonholed their accounts of the human past into discrete cubicles (social, economic, political history, etc.). By contrast, Zeldin attempts a history of human thoughts and feelings unfettered by considerations of historical epoch or culture. Each chapter focuses on a particular thought or feeling, such as toil, the art of conversation, voluntarism, compassion, attitudes on class and social status, and authority. To organize his ideas, Zeldin employs a masterful new technique. After introducing each chapter with a personal vignette based on interviews he has conducted with individuals musing on the meaning of some aspect of their lives, Zeldin traces changes or commonalities in that feeling across time and place. General readers will be inspired by this thought-provoking and immensely readable work.?Marie Marmo Mullaney, Caldwell Coll., N.J.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Single Man</h2><p>&#39;The best prose writer in English&#39; - Gore Vidal. Celebrated as a masterpiece from its first publication, &#34;A Single Man&#34; is the story of George Falconer, an English professor in suburban California left heartbroken after the death of his lover Jim. With devastating clarity and humour, Christopher Isherwood shows George&#39;s determination to carry on, evoking the unexpected pleasures of life as well as the soul&#39;s ability to triumph over loneliness and alienation. &#39;A virtuoso piece of work...courageous...powerful&#39; - &#34;Sunday Times&#34;.</p><p>Christopher Isherwood was born in 1904. He began to write at university and later moved to Berlin, where he gave English lessons to support himself. He witnessed first hand the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany and some of his best works, such as Mr. Norris Changes Trains and Goodbye to Berlin, draw on these experiences. He created the character of Sally Bowles, later made famous as the heroine of the musical Cabaret. Isherwood travelled with W.H Auden to China in the late 1930s before going with him to America in 1939. He died on 4 January 1986.Isherwood's resurrected classic&#x2014;now a feature film&#x2014;takes us to Southern California in the 1960s and into one day in the life of George, a gay, middle-aged English professor, struggling to cope with his young lover's tragic death. Simon Prebble's voice is a perfect conduit for Isherwood's lyricism, and he assumes the role of George so naturally and with such raw feeling that listeners will feel as if they are hearing the words straight from the protagonist himself, so beautifully does Prebble create George's reserve behind which surge tides of grief, rage, and bitter loneliness. <i>A University of Minnesota paperback.

Tour.</p><p>Neither coy nor restrained, and freed of a time-limited divorce-settlement clause that forbade her to discuss her marriage, the former Mrs. David Bowie describes in no uncertain terms the torrid "open marriage" she shared with the singer known as the Thin White Duke. The couple met in 1968, married in 1970, and were estranged long before their 1980 divorce. Here, Angela Bowie (nee Barnett, an American citizen born in Greece), with assistance from freelance journalist Carr, proudly affirms her bisexuality as well as that of her "dear ex-husband," and describes with considerable relish their dalliances with sundry gender-benders of the glitterati. Sex and drugs far outweigh the rock 'n' roll: this is the book to read for details about David Bowie in bed with Mick Jagger; for the sexual scoop on Rod Stewart, Lou Reed, Marianne Faithfull and numerous now-deceased performers.

Can we stop now?"</i><br>Kimberly Crepeaux is no good, a notorious jailhouse snitch, teen mother, and heroin addict whose petty crimes are well-known to the rural Maine community where she lives. So when she confesses to her role in the brutal murders of Jackie Pelletier and Ian Kelly, the daughter of a well-known local family and her sweetheart, the locals have little reason to believe her story. <br>Not Rob Barrett, the FBI investigator and interrogator specializing in telling a true confession from a falsehood. He's been circling Kimberly and her conspirators for months, waiting for the right avenue to the truth, and has finally found it. He knows, as strongly as he's known anything, that Kimberly's story-a grisly, harrowing story of a hit and run fueled by dope and cheap beer that becomes a brutal stabbing in cold blood-is how it happened. But one thing remains elusive: where are Jackie and Ian's bodies?<br>After Barrett stakes his name and reputation on the truth of Kimberly's confession, only to have the bodies turn up 200 miles from where she said they'd be, shot in the back and covered in a different suspect's DNA, the case is quickly closed and Barrett forcibly reassigned. But for Howard Pelletier, the tragedy of his daughter's murder cannot be so tidily swept away.

We rely upon computers, cell phones, and the Internet for communication, commerce, and entertainment. Yet even though we live in this &#x201c;instant message&#x201d; culture, many of us feel disconnected, and we question if all this technology is really good for our souls. In a manner that&#x2019;s accessible, thoughtful, and biblical, author Tim Challies addresses questions such as:� How has life&#x2015;and faith&#x2015;changed now that everyone is available all the time through mobile phones?� How does our constant connection to these digital devices affect our families and our church communities? � What does it mean that almost two billion humans are connected by the Internet ... with hundreds of millions more coming online each year?Providing the reader with a framework they can apply to any technology, Tim Challies explains how and why our society has become reliant on digital technology, what it means for our lives, and how it impacts the Christian faith.</p><p><p>A pastor, noted speaker, and author of numerous articles, Tim Challies is a pioneer in the Christian blogosphere.

He and his family reside near Toronto, Ontario.</p>Tim Challies knows technology and he knows the faith. So, when he writes on the intersection of technology and faith, it's a must read. The Next Story gives solid counsel to living out the gospel in the context of today's rapid progression of technology. -- Ed Stetzer<br><br>This is an important book. As someone who has spent almost two decades helping couples and families grow stronger and thrive, I have seen how what Tim Challies calls the digital explosion is sending shock waves through homes &#x2013; everything from Facebook threatening marriages to couples who can&#x2019;t have a conversation that goes deeper than a tweet. It&#x2019;s time we think seriously about the subtle way technology is reordering our lives. The Next Story helps us do that. - Bob Lepine, Co-Host, FamilyLife Today -- Bob Lepine<br><br>When we think about technology, most of us are content to focus naively on features and price. Thankfully, Tim Challies calls us to something deeper. The Next Story is a compelling call for God's people to consider technology's implications, effects, and tendencies. Challies demonstrates thoughtful examination of what technology can do to us, rather than what it can do for us. --- Scott McClellan, Echo Conference -- Scott McClellan<br><br>We all marvel at the rapid technological advances that have taken place in our lifetime. But few of us stop to reflect on the profound way these changes are shaping what it means to be human. The Next Story is a great place to start. It moves beyond warnings simply to be careful what we see (important though these are) to explore how the medium of new technology affects how we know God, relate to other people and even how we think. Instead of simplistic rules or proof texts, it offers a penetrating analysis of the modern world in the light of the biblical story together with practical principles that will enable you to ensure technology is your tool and not your master. - Tim Chester, author, leader in The Crowded House, and co-director of The Porterbrook Network -- Tim Chester, Author<br><br>As the co-author of 13 words in Tim's new book, I'm very happy that he, with his skill as a writer, his experience with as a web designer, and his deeply informed, discerning faith, wrote the other 60,000.

Albert Mohler Jr., President<br><br>There are many books evaluating the nature and impact of new media. There are many books on Christian discipleship. However, this book brings these issues together, with profound simplicity and well-informed analysis.

Where is wisdom in the immediacy of the information explosion? Can we really affirm biblical authority when Wikipedia is truth? Tim Challies uses theoretical, experiential and theological lenses to give us a prophetic assessment of our digital age. He unpacks the opportunities of increased connection as well as the new Gnosticism of the dis-incarnations of the virtual society. He calls us to extricate ourselves from the ADHD world of information overload to live as whole persons giving ourselves to wisdom and worship of God alone. -- Dr. Gerry Breshears, Professor<br><br>All of us today---whether 'digital immigrants' or 'digital natives'---are living in the after-shock of the 'digital explosion.' Though our world has radically and rapidly changed, the fundamental question has remained the same: will we be found faithful? Tim Challies proves to be a faithful navigator, though humble enough to admit that he identifies with the rest of us as a fellow struggler. The result of his labors is an accessible guide full of wise reflection and practical counsel. What hath technology to do with the biblical worldview?

Respectful of the techniques and history of Indian cuisine but eager to experiment, Bhide has written simple but deeply flavorful recipes. <i>Modern Spice</i> takes the vibrant tastes of India into the twenty-first century with a cookbook that is young, fun, sassy, and bold. <br> <br> Dishes like Pomegranate Shrimp, Paneer and Fig Pizza, and Coriander-and-Fennel-Crusted Lamb Chops are contemporary and creative. Bhide pours Guava Bellinis and Tamaritas for her guests, and serves Chile Pea Puffs and Indian Chicken Wings; instead of Chicken Tikka Masala, she serves Chicken with Mint and Ginger Rub. Make-ahead condiments such as Pineapple Lentil Relish and Kumquat and Mango Chutney with Onion Seeds add a piquant accent to the simplest dish. There are plenty of options for everyday meals, including Butternut Squash Stew with Jaggery, Indian-Style Chili in Bread Bowls, and Crabby Vermicelli, along with plentiful recipes for elegant dishes like Tamarind-Glazed Honey Shrimp and Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Paneer. For an original and effortless finish, spoon Raspberry and Fig Jam Topping over tart frozen yogurt or a store-bought pound cake, or if you have more time, tempt guests with exotic sweets such as Saffron-Cardamom Macaroons or Rice Pudding and Mango Parfait. <br> <br> As Mark Bittman says in his foreword, "there is not a cuisine that uses spices with more grace and craft than that of India," and Bhide's recipes do so, but without long and daunting lists of exotic ingredients. In keeping with its local approach to global flavors, <i>Modern Spice</i> includes a guide to the modern Indian pantry and Monica's thoughtful, charming essays on food, culture, and family. Eight pages of gorgeous color photographs showcase the recipes.</p><p>Mark Bittman is the author of&nbsp;<i>Food Matters,</i>&nbsp;<i>How to Cook Everything</i> and other cookbooks, and of the weekly <i>New York Times</i> column, <i>The Minimalist</i>.

"When I first cooked a ham, I didn't have a pan big enough."</i></p></blockquote><p>I love this story -- just because we have always done things in one way, it does not make it the only way to do something. So if fennel- and-chile-crusted tilapia and basmati rice with pine nuts and mint, accompanied by a Guava Bellini, does not sound Indian to you, think again! Indian food has come a long way from the same old, same old world of mango lassis and tandoori chicken. While traditional Indian cooking required slaving in the kitchen for hours, modern Indian cooking makes a virtue of quick-cook techniques. While traditional Indian cooking relied on a myriad of spices and herbs, modern Indian cooking focuses on taking a few spices and bringing out their flavors. While traditional Indian cooking was perceived to be difficult and fussy, the foundation of modern Indian cooking is perfection in simplicity.</p><p>Yes, as a new generation of modern Indians, we are changing everything.</p><p>We love tradition, but embody change.</p><p>We respect technique, but are playful.</p><p>Our style is refined; our tastes are global.</p><p>Our new cuisine is a reflection of our lives today, here and now. Just as traditional curries and dishes cooked painstakingly from scratch reflect our mothers' and grandmothers' generations, our dishes reflect our modern lifestyles. They are easy, fun, and intensely flavorful.</p><p>This fun, sassy approach to Indian-inspired food is what you will find in this book. The recipes I have created and present here are vibrant and enticing, yet they are simple, refined, and adapted to modern lifestyles: this is Indian food as it is cooked now. This is a book for today's generation that does not want yesterday's style of doing things. As a community we are creating new styles, new traditions, and a new cuisine that needs to be captured.</p><p>This book takes Indian cooking and translates it for our generation -- this book embraces the intense, spicy, Indian flavors but is not stuck on an artificial standard of authenticity that no longer exists even in India.</p><p>I understand the soul of Indian cuisine; I understand the dishes, their roots, and the richness of history that surrounds the food. It is this knowledge that sets me free and gives me the freedom to play with them, to evolve the dishes. Growing up in the Middle East, I learned authentic Indian dishes from the talented and knowledgeable hands of my father and mother. During frequent visits to India, I moved from my grandmother's kitchen to those of my mother's cousins and friends, along the way gathering delightful anecdotes and learning authentic recipes. Fifteen years ago I moved to the United States, and since then the Indian cooking that I learned has changed so much. All these experiences are what I am sharing with you in <i>Modern Spice</i>.</p><p>This book does not have any recipes for mango lassi -- there are 200 books out there (including two of my own!) that you can read for that -- instead it brings you a Guava Bellini. It doesn't offer chicken tikka masala; it provides a recipe for chicken gently simmered in fresh cilantro and mint. This is Indian, my way: a reflection of the Indian cooking of today and the style of the modern Indian.Copyright � 2009 by Monica Bhide</p></p><h2>Capacity</h2><p>Intricate, even exquisite - but never immaculate, Theo Ellsworth's <i>Capacity</i> is a mind turned inside out. Ellsworth's careful line gives shape to profound and profoundly silly thoughts alike, bringing a visionary, startling new life to the doubts and hopes that are so familiar to everyone. This is the 2010 reprint of Theo Ellsworth's debut graphic novel. <i>Capacity</i>.</p><p>Theo Ellsworth is a self-taught artist and storyteller who grew up in the mountains of Montana. He developed his art while wandering the United States in a motor powered vehicle. He is uncommonly fond of clouds, monsters, trees, and impossible objects. He is prone to fits of whimsy, and his mind is filled with preposterous notions, yet he still manages to come across as semi-normal. He now lives in Portland, Oregon with a witch doctor and a slightly evil cat, and spends as much time as possible making comics, art zines, and imaginary phenomenon. He also helps run the Pony Club gallery, which he co-founded. He has replaced his motor powered vehicle with a two-wheeled, human-powered contraption.A surreal journey through exquisitely crosshatched forests, cities and caverns, where the beasts populating dreams become skittish at the scent of the dreamer. --<i>The Village Voice</i><br><br>Exactly the kind of book you discover in a dream - perhaps a whole library full - and long for so badly when they vanish upon waking. Only this one still exists in the conscious world. An indispensable visionary handbook with crossover instructions for navigating the dreams we dream in our sleep and the dream that's dreaming us. --Craig Thompson, author of <i>Blankets</i><br><br>Theo Ellsworth's <i>Capacity</i> comics are a treasure. --Eric Nakamura, Giant Robot</p><h2>Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7) (Adult Edition)</h2><p>Now for the first time ever, J.K.

They renounce family, belongings, and desires in order to lead lives of complete non-violence. In their communities, Jain ascetics play key roles as teachers and exemplars of the truth; they are embodiments of the <i>lokottar</i> - the realm of the transcendent.</p><p>Based on thirteen months of fieldwork in the town of Ladnun, Rajasthan, India, among a community of Terapanthi Svetambar Jains, this book explores the many facets of what constitutes a moral life within the Terapanthi ascetic community, and examines the central role ascetics play in upholding the Jain moral order. Focussing on the Terapanthi moral universe from the perspective of female renouncers, Vallely considers how Terapanthi Jain women create their own ascetic subjectivities, and how they construct and understand themselves as symbols of renunciation. The first in-depth ethnographic study of this important and influential Jain tradition, this work makes a significant contribution to Jain studies, comparative religion, Indian studies, and the anthropology of South Asian religion. </p></p><p><p>'Some of the best ethnographic writing I've seen in quite some time ...

But Will is ready to leave Atwater, Ohio, and start a life of his own as a peddler seeking his fortune.

H. U. Johnson<br><br>From Dixie to Canada<br><br>Remember, Tom, if you hear horses, don't speed up, no matter what."<br><br>"I know, Will. You told me that at least five times on the last ride."<br><br>"The last ride was practice," I replied. "This one's for real. We have a passenger under the floorboards, so you've got to be careful."<br><br>We sat in Papa's wagon heading north from Atwater to Ravenna, a trip I'd made so often, I could have dropped the reins, for my horses knew the way. But this time my horses weren't doing the pulling and my hands weren't holding the reins. My younger brother, Tom, was making his first trip, and I was making my last in the dim light of a quarter moon.<br><br>"That Noah, he seemed pretty scared," Tom said, lowering his voice to a whisper.<br><br>"You'd be scared too, if you were all alone in a strange Northern place, getting hauled from hither to yon by folks you didn't know. He didn't look much older than you, Tom. Imagine that."<br><br>"No thanks. I'd just as soon stay put. Lucky for me, I can."<br><br>We were lucky, I thought, at least Tom was. He liked Atwater, Ohio. Loved the land and the life of a farmer. Course, him loving it was lucky for me as well, for it meant Papa could count on Tom for help in the fields and would allow me to leave. Tomorrow at first light I would begin my new life. But I had one last trip to make, and there wasn't a soul I'd rather be making it with than Tom. I'd been driving for the Railroad on dark nights like this one for years and was leaving my route to my brother.<br><br>As if reading my thoughts, he started in on me again, trying to talk me out of it. "You sure you really want to leave home? Think of Mama's cooking! A peddler's wagon can't be very comfortable, compared to our house. It's going to be mighty lonely with just your horses to talk to."<br><br>"My team's got more sense than most folks," I said. "A little peace and quiet will be a nice change from all the biddies of Atwater grinding our names in the mud."<br><br>Until three years ago, I'd liked our town and most of the people in it. But that was before my sister Lucy got herself caught transporting a slave baby north to Canada and claimed she was the child's mother to save its life. After that, Lucy couldn't come back, and now half the town treated the rest of us Spencers like we'd caught the plague. Somehow, it didn't bother Tom like it did me. He was kind of a duck, and the whispers and rumors rolled right off his back like water. Me, I answered every snub and insult with my fists, and I'd gotten tired of it all.<br><br>"Will, the Reverend told me Noah's been chased on his trip north," Tom said, his voice still quiet. "He's heard hounds baying and had to wade the creeks several nights."<br><br>That made me sit up straight. "All the more reason for us to be careful, then. You got your excuses ready if somebody stops us."<br><br>"Who's going to believe some girl would want me to come calling?" Tom demanded. "Even if I liked the notion, which I don't."<br><br>"Give it a year or two," I said, grinning. "Girls ain't so bad. Might even find you like kissing."<br><br>Tom rolled his eyes. "You won't get me kissing some girl. Trading spit, that's all it is."<br><br>"Maybe. But how will you know unless you give it a try?" I'd kissed a couple of girls and liked it just fine, but I was sixteen, nearly grown. Tom was just coming up on thirteen and still had a lot to learn.<br><br>His elbow poked me hard in the ribs just as my ears caught the sound of distant hoofbeats. He tensed beside me and I listened carefully. Sounded like more than one horse, and the riders were coming from behind, the dangerous direction--somebody might be tracking Noah.<br><br>A sweat broke out on my forehead, and I rapped on the floor of the wagon, warning Noah to be extra quiet. I hoped he wouldn't panic. "Remember, Tom, don't speed up. Makes you look like you've got something to hide."<br><br>"You want to take the reins, Will? I don't mind if you do." Tom's voice shook.<br><br>My fingers itched to grab the reins, but if Tom was going to take on the route, he'd have to take on the trouble that sometimes came with it. I slapped him lightly on the shoulder. "You drive. You'll do just fine."<br><br>He gave me a quick nod and sat straighter, squaring his shoulders. It was my turn to poke him in the ribs. "Relax. Don't go all stiff and nervous. Think about kissing again."<br><br>He chuckled and shook his head. "You going to tell me the names of all the girls you've kissed, since you're such an expert?"<br><br>As the horses grew closer, I could hear the voices of dogs yapping and knew I had to keep Tom from tensing up again. "Your first lesson in kissing is not to shout the girl's name to the world. Not if you want to kiss her more than once." I paused, then whispered, "Dogs, you hear them?"<br><br>"Yep."<br><br>"You ready?"<br><br>"Nope. But I'll do what it takes."<br><br>That I could believe, for although I'd mostly been driving lately, before our sister Lucy got caught and the town grew suspicious, our family had run an underground Railroad station at our farm. Back then, Tom had helped plenty, even when he was pretty young.<br><br>The hoofbeats grew louder and closer, and the dogs set up a loud baying howl. Within minutes two strangers in dark clothing pulled even with us, one on each side of the wagon.<br><br>"Evening, gentlemen," I said, making my voice friendly and cheerful. "Hope you've got room to pass. Sorry if we're traveling too slow for you."<br><br>The man on my side answered in a gruff voice. "You could slow down and even stop, if you wouldn't mind. We'd like to talk to you."<br><br>"Sure thing," I replied. "Pull up there, Tom. Let's have a word with these fellas."<br><br>Tom pulled the team to a stop, and as he did, the two men reined in their horses and dismounted quickly. I swung down from the wagon and placed my body between them and the wagon bed. As soon as Tom had tied off the reins, he joined me. It was one of those times I blessed Papa's large size, for even though I wasn't all the way grown, I stood half a head taller than the men. I hoped that in the dark they wouldn't be able to tell how young Tom and I really were.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Victorian Posy</h2><p>A treasury of poetry, prose, and art celebrating the charm and beauty of the English garden, with marbled endpapers, slipcase, and silk ribbon marker. <b>74 full-color illustrations.</b></p><p>f poetry, prose, and art celebrating the charm and beauty of the English garden, with marbled endpapers, slipcase, and silk ribbon marker. <b>74 full-color illustrations.</b></p><h2>The Zen Teachings of Huang Po (Shambhala Pocket Classics)</h2><p>The teacher of the famous Lin-chi (who went on to found the Rinzai school of Zen), Huang Po is regarded by many to be one of the greatest Zen masters.

The inspiration for Capote's writing, he states, was not experience but reading, and as time went on, instead of writing, he "talked about the writing he was going to do." He was "always engaged in fantasy and web-spinning," and "his frail respect for the distinction between the truth and invention became even frailer." At a certain point, Williams, too, "ceased to be able to distinguish between truth and untruth." Like other recent books on these two unhappy writers, Windham's memoir is a depressing account of wasted lives and talents. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.A long-time friend of both Capote and Williams, Windham gives a compelling portrait of these two important American writers. Part 1, "Footnote to a Friendship," focuses on Capote. Part 2, "As if . . . ," depicts his more complex friendship with Williams (they collaborated on a play, You Touched Me , and he edited a volume of the playwright's letters). In telling their story, Windham spans four decades of literary life, bringing into his memoir other writers and luminariesGore Vidal, Isak Dinesen, and Andre Gide among them.

The surrounding jungle bulged with life. Overgrown green bushes blocked our path, vines hung from the tree canopy, and the constant chatter and trill ofjungle birds beat at my ears. Small furry creatures, who had been following us through the jungle, peeked at us from their hiding spots behind huge leaves.<br><br>"Where?" I asked, glancing at the three other girls. They shrugged in unison, equally confused. In the thick humid air, their thin cotton dresses were soaked in sweat. My own black pants and white shirt clung to my clammy skin. We were tired from lugging our heavy backpacks along snake-thin jungle paths, and itchy from hosting unnameable insects on our skins.<br><br>"The Zaltana homestead," Irys said. "Quite possibly <i>your </i>home."<br><br>I surveyed the lush greenery and saw nothing that resembled a settlement. During the course of our travels south, whenever Irys had declared that we had arrived, we were usually in the midst of a small town or village, with houses made of wood, stone or brick, hemmed in by fields and farms.<br><br>The brightly dressed inhabitants would welcome us, feed us and, amid a cacophony of voices and spicy aromas, listen to our story. Then certain families would be summoned with great haste. In a whirlwind of excitement and babble, one of the children in our party, who had lived in the orphanage in the north, would be reunited with a family they hadn't known existed.<br><br>As a result, our group had grown ever smaller as we'd traveled farther into the southern land of Sitia. Soon, we had left the cold northern air far behind, and were now cooking in the steamy warmth of the jungle with no sign of a town in sight.<br><br>"Homestead?" I asked.<br><br>Irys sighed. Wisps of her black hair had sprung from her tight bun, and her stern expression didn't quite match the slight humor in her emerald eyes.<br><br>"Yelena, appearances can be deceiving. Seek with your mind, not your senses," she instructed.<br><br>I rubbed my slick hands along the grain of my wooden staff, concentrating on its smooth surface. My mind emptied, and the buzz of the jungle faded as I sent out my mental awareness. In my mind's eye, I slithered through the underbrush with a snake, searching for a patch of sunlight. I scrambled through the tree branches with a long-limbed animal with such ease that it felt as if we flew.<br><br>Then, above, I moved with people among the treetops. Their minds were open and relaxed, deciding what to eat for dinner, and discussing the news from the city. But one mind worried about the sounds from the jungle below. Something wasn't right. Someone strange was there. Possible danger. <i>Who's in my mind?</i><br><br>I snapped back to myself. Irys stared at me.<br><br>"They live in the trees?" I asked.<br><br>She nodded. "But remember Yelena, just because someone's mind is receptive to your probing doesn't mean you're permitted to dive into their deeper thoughts. That's a breach of our Ethical Code."<br><br>Her words were harsh, the master level magician scolding her student.<br><br>"Sorry," I said.<br><br>She shook her head. "I forget that you're still learning. We need to get to the Citadel and begin your training, but I'm afraid this stop will take some time."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"I can't leave you with your family like I did for the other children, and it would be cruel to take you away too soon."<br><br>Just then, a loud voice from above called out, "Venettaden."<br><br>Irys swung her arm up and mumbled something, but my muscles froze before I could repel the magic that engulfed us. I couldn't move. After a frantic moment of panic, I calmed my mind. I tried to build a mental wall of defense, but the magic that ensnared me knocked down my mental bricks as fast as I could stack them.<br><br>Irys, however, was unaffected. She yelled into the treetops. "We're friends of the Zaltanas. I'm Irys of the Jewelrose Clan, Fourth Magician in the Council."<br><br>Another strange word echoed from the trees. My legs trembled as the magic released me and I sank to the ground to wait for the faintness to pass. The twins, Gracena and Nickeely collapsed together, moaning. May rubbed her legs.<br><br>"Why have you come, Irys Jewelrose?" the voice above asked.<br><br>"I believe I may have found your lost daughter," she replied.<br><br>A rope ladder descended through the branches.<br><br>"Let's go, girls," Irys said. "Here, Yelena, hold the bottom while we climb."<br><br>A peevish thought about who would hold the ladder for me flashed through my mind. Irys's annoyed voice admonished me in my own head. <i>Yelena, you will have no trouble getting into the trees. Perhaps I should have them raise the ladder when it's your turn to climb, as you might prefer to use your grapple and rope.</i><br><br>She was right, of course. I had used the trees to hide from my enemies in Ixia without the convenience of a ladder. And even now, I'd enjoyed an occasional "walk" through the treetops to keep my skills honed.<br><br>Irys smiled at me. <i>Perhaps it's in your blood.</i><br><br>My stomach filled with unease as I remembered Mogkan. He had said I was cursed with Zaltana blood. I'd no reason to trust the now dead southern magician, though, and I'd been avoiding asking Irys questions about the Zaltanas so I wouldn't get my hopes up about being a part of their family. Even while dying, I knew Mogkan would have been capable of pulling one last spiteful trick.<br><br>Mogkan and General Brazell's son, Reyad, had kidnapped me along with over thirty other children from Sitia. Averaging two children a year, they had brought the girls and boys north to Brazell's "orphanage" in the Territory of Ixia for use in their twisted plans. All of the children had the potential of becoming magicians because they had been born to families with strong magic.<br><br>Irys had explained to me that magical powers were a gift, and only a handful of magicians came from each clan. "Of course, the more magicians in a family," Irys had said, "the greater chance of having more in the next generation. Mogkan took a risk kidnapping children so young; magical powers don't manifest until a child reaches maturity."<br><br>"Why were there more girls than boys?" I had asked.<br><br>"Only thirty percent of our magicians are males, and Bain Bloodgood is the only one to achieve master level status."<br><br>As I steadied the rope ladder that hung from the jungle's canopy, I now wondered how many Zaltanas were magicians. Beside me, the three girls tucked the hems of their dresses into their belts. Irys helped May start up the rope rungs, and then Gracena and Nickeely followed.<br><br>When we had crossed the border into Sitia, the girls hadn't hesitated to exchange their northern uniforms for the bright multicolored, cotton dresses worn by some of the southern women. The boys switched their uniforms for simple cotton pants and tunics. I, on the other hand, had kept my food taster's uniform on until the heat and humidity had driven me to purchase a pair of boy's cotton pants and a shirt.<br><br>After Irys disappeared into the green canopy, I set my boot on the bottom rung. My feet felt as if they were swollen with water, weighing me down. Reluctance clung to my legs as I dragged them up the ladder. In midair, I paused. What if these people didn't want me? What if they didn't believe I was their lost daughter? What if I were too old to be bothered with?<br><br>All the children who had already found their homes had been immediately accepted. Between the ages of seven and thirteen, they had been separated from their families for only a few years. Physical resemblances, ages, and even names had made it easy to place them. Now, we were down to four. The identical twins, Gracena and Nickeely were thirteen. May was the youngest at twelve, and I was the oldest of the group at twenty.<br><br>According to Irys, the Zaltanas had lost a six-year-old girl over fourteen years prior. That was a long time to be away. I was no longer a child.<br><br>Yet I was the oldest one who had survived Brazell's plans and remained whole. When the other kidnapped children reach maturity, those who had developed magical powers had been tortured until they surrendered their souls to Mogkan and Reyad. Mogkan had then used the magic of these now mindless captives to enhance his own, making the children nothing more than living bodies without souls.<br><br>Irys bore the burden of informing the families of these children, but I felt some guilt by being the only one to survive Mogkan's efforts to capture my soul. The effort, though, cost me a great deal.<br><br>Thinking about my struggles in Ixia led to thoughts of Valek. An ache for him chewed at my heart. Hooking an arm around the ladder, I fingered the butterfly pendant he had carved for me. Perhaps I could devise a way to return to Ixia. After all, the magic in my body no longer flared out of control, and I would much rather be with him than among these strange southerners who lived in the trees. Even the name of the south, Sitia, felt thick as rancid syrup in my mouth.<br><br>"Yelena, come on," Irys called down to me. "We're waiting."<br><br>I swallowed hard and ran a hand over my long braid, smoothing my black hair and pulling out the few viney tendrils that clung to it. Despite the long trek through the jungle, I wasn't too tired. While shorter than most Ixians at five feet four inches, my body had transformed from emaciated to muscular during my last year in Ixia. The difference had been in my living arrangements. From starving in the dungeon to tasting food for Commander Ambrose, my situation had improved for my physical well-being, but I couldn't say the same for my mental well-being during that time.<br><br>I shook my head, banishing those thoughts and concentrating on my immediate circumstances. Climbing up the rest of the ladder, I expected it to end at a wide branch or a platform in the tree like a landing on a staircase. Instead, I entered a room.<br><br>I looked around in amazement. The walls and ceiling of the room were formed by branches and limbs that had been roped together. Sunlight leaked in between the gaps. Bundled sticks had been worked into chairs that had cushions made of leaves. The small room held only four seats.<br><br>"Is this her?" a tall man asked Irys. His cotton tunic and short pants were the color of the tree's leaves. Green gel had been combed into his hair and smeared over all his exposed skin. A bow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. I guessed he was the guard. Why, though, would he need a weapon if he were the magician who had frozen us? Then again, Irys had deflected that spell with ease. Could she turn aside an arrow as well?<br><br>"Yes," Irys said to the man.<br><br>"We've heard rumors at the market, and wondered if you would pay us a visit, Fourth Magician. Please, stay here," he said. "I'll get the Elder."<br><br>Irys sank into one of the chairs, and the girls explored the room, exclaiming over the view from the single window. I paced the narrow space. The guard seemed to disappear through the wall, but upon investigation, I discovered a gap that led to a bridge also made of branches.<br><br>"Sit down," Irys said to me. "Relax. You're safe here."<br><br>"Even with that heartwarming reception?" I countered.<br><br>"Standard procedure. Unaccompanied visitors are extremely rare. With the constant danger of jungle predators, most travelers hire a Zaltana guide. You've been edgy and defensive ever since I told you we were headed to the Zaltana's village."<br><br>Irys pointed at my legs. "You're in a fighting stance, prepared for attack. These people are your family. Why would they want to hurt you?"<br><br>I realized that I had pulled my weapon off my back, and was clutching it in the ready position. With effort, I relaxed my posture.<br><br>"Sorry." I threaded the bow, a five-foot wooden staff, back into its holder on the side of my backpack.<br><br>Fear of the unknown had caused me to clench. For as long as I could remember in Ixia, I had been told my family was dead. Lost to me forever. Even so, I used to dream of finding an adopted family who would love and care for me. I had only given up that fantasy when I had been turned into Mogkan and Reyad's experiment, and now that I had Valek, I felt I didn't need a family.<br><br>"That's not true, Yelena," Irys said aloud. "Your family will help you discover who you are and why. You need them more than you know."<br><br>"I thought you said it was against your Ethical Code to read someone's mind." I rankled at her intrusion on my private thoughts.<br><br>"We are linked as teacher and student. You freely gave me a pathway to your mind by accepting me as your mentor. It would be easier to divert a waterfall than to break our link."<br><br>"I don't remember creating a pathway," I grumbled.<br><br>"If there was a conscious effort in making a link, it wouldn't have happened." She watched my face for a while. "You gave me your trust and your loyalty. That was all that was needed to forge a bond. While I won't pry into your intimate thoughts and memories, I can pick up on your surface emotions."<br><br>I opened my mouth to reply, but the green-haired guard returned.<br><br>"Follow me," he said.<br><br>We wound our way through the treetops. Hallways and bridges connected room after room high above the land. There had been no hint of this maze of dwellings from the ground. We didn't see or meet a soul as we passed around bedrooms and through living areas. From glimpses into the rooms, I saw they were decorated with items found in the jungle. Coconut shells, nuts, berries, grasses, twigs and leaves were all artfully arranged into wall hangings, book covers, boxes and statues. Someone had even fashioned an exact replica of one of those long-tailed animals by using white and black stones glued together.<br><br>"Irys," I said, pointing to the statue, "what are those animals?"<br><br>"Valmurs. Very intelligent and playful. There are millions of them in the jungle. They're curious, too. Remember how they spied on us from the trees?"<br><br>I nodded, recalling the little creatures that never stood still long enough for me to study. In other rooms, I spotted more animal replicas made from different colored stones. A hollow-ness touched my throat as I thought of Valek and the animals he carved out of rocks. I knew he would appreciate the craftsmanship of these stone statues. Perhaps I could send one to him.<br><br>I didn't know when I'd ever be able to see him again. The Commander had exiled me to Sitia when he had discovered I possessed magical powers. If I returned to Ixia, the Commander's order of execution would be in effect, but he had never said I couldn't communicate with my friends in Ixia.<br><br></p><h2>The Guy Book: An Owner&#39;s Manual (Maintenance, Safety, and Operating Instructions for Teens)</h2><p>Mavis Jukes is the queen of girl talk, but this time she&#x2019;s set her sights on the guys.

Covering a range of topics, from masturbation to decoding girls' signals to making that earth-shattering choice between boxers and briefs, this wise collection of information and how-tos will appeal to the testosterone-ridden boy who would sooner die than ask his mom or one of his buddies about spontaneous erections or confusing emotions. On the other hand, Jukes encourages readers throughout to talk to friends and caring, responsible adults, and offers guy-appropriate lingo and tips to help facilitate tough situations. On breaking up with a girl: "Breaking up on a Saturday afternoon at your soon-to-be-ex's house (where support is available) would be better than springing it on a Monday morning at school."

It is also a memoir of the soldier known as � Lawrence of Arabia.� Lawrence was a fascinating and controversial figure whose talent as a vivid and imaginative writer shines through on every page of this, his masterpiece. <br><br>� It ranks with the greatest books ever written in the English language. As a narrative of war and adventure . . . it is unsurpassable.� � Winston Churchill</p><p>This is the exciting and highly literate story of the real Lawrence of Arabia, as written by Lawrence himself, who helped unify Arab factions against the occupying Turkish army, circa World War I. Lawrence has a novelist&#39;s eye for detail, a poet&#39;s command of the language, an adventurer&#39;s heart, a soldier&#39;s great story, and his memory and intellect are at least as good as all those. Lawrence describes the famous guerrilla raids, and train bombings you know from the movie, but also tells of the Arab people and politics with great penetration. Moreover, he is witty, always aware of the ethical tightrope that the English walked in the Middle East and always willing to include himself in his own withering insight.The monumental work that assured T.E. Lawrence&#39;s place in history as &#34;Lawrence of Arabia.&#34; Not only a consummate military history, but also a colorful epic and a lyrical exploration of the mind of a great man who helped shape the Middle East as it exists today.</p><h2>Swords And Deviltry (The First Book of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser)</h2><p><p> <b>The First Volume in ibooks' Reissues of the Fantasies by Science Fiction Writers of America Grand Master Fritz Leiber!</b> </p><p> Swords and Deviltry introduces us to a strange world where fantastic but thoroughly flawed anti-heroes Fafhrd and Gray Mouser find the familiar in themselves and discover the icy power of female magic.

Now based in Georgia, Armitage began his gardening career in Montreal. Thus, he knows a lot about what happens to plants in both Northern and Southern gardens. He shares his experience and experiments with great good will, offering a depth and breadth of information that is rarely surpassed. Armitage's take on hundreds of hardy perennials includes cultural specifics, propagation techniques, and suggested companions. This chunky book may seem intimidating, but don't let the textbook look put you off--all the information, technical or otherwise, is presented in clear, accessible terms that won't puzzle beginners yet offer advanced gardeners the answers they are seeking. On the whole, Armitage avoids trendy tender perennials such as <i>Meconopsis</i> (the blue Himalayan poppy) that don't perform well for most North American gardeners. His focus is on solidly hardy plants, those that thrive in USDA zones 3 to 8. He does, however, include a few newly popular plants such as <i>Gunnera</i>, the enormous Chilean foliage plants, and there are lengthy sections for hellebores, heucheras, and other horticulturally hot plants, mentioning and rating many of the newest named selections. <i>--Ann Lovejoy</i>Armitage's wonderful, lively descriptions of both ordinary and rare perennials more than offset the limited number of photos and illustrations.

Meet Archy McNally, a freewheeling playboy who specializes is "Discreet Inquires" for the rich and not-so-discreet. Beneath the glaring sun of Palm Beach--and behind the lowest crimes of high society--McNally is paid to keep family skeletons in the closet. But when it comes to sex and scandal, McNally has a few secrets of his own...</p><p>Lawrence Sanders, one of America's most popular novelists, was the author of more than twenty-two bestsellers.<b> </b>Glib, suave Archy McNally makes discreet investigations for the gentry of tony, decadent Palm Beach. This latest adventure begins with a stolen rare stamp, for which he searches through some skeleton-filled closets, including his own. But it hardly matters. For the reader, the delight of McNally's cases lies less in the plot than in the Dickensian characters he encounters (and beds), his banter with them, and his comments on them. All these are amplified through the sensibility of Adam Henderson. Not at all suave, he has a fey, untrained sound.

With Tilla getting icy greetings from his relatives, Lucius's brother-inlaw mysteriously drowned at sea, and the whole Ruso family teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, it's hard to imagine an unhappier reunion. That is, until Severus, the family's chief creditor, winds up dead, and the real trouble begins... </p><p>Engrossing, intricate, and&#x2015;as always&#x2015;wonderfully comic, Ruth Downie's latest is a brilliant new installment in this irresistible series.

Ruso returns to his family home in southern Gaul, summoned by a forged letter pleading for his immediate return. Once Ruso and Tilla return, Ruso is thrust into a dangerous quagmire involving a missing ship, huge family debts and, before long, the murder of the family's principal creditor&#x2014;a crafty phony named Severus&#x2014;who is poisoned in Ruso's home. While Ruso and his family are quickly suspected of the murder, Ruso and Tilla's attempts to solve the crime are hampered by interfering family members, a lying politician, a greedy banker and a pair of too-eager investigators sent from Rome. Ruso and Tilla must also deal with prejudice, envy and a new religion, Christianity. The plotting is clever and suspenseful, with subtle clues and lots of action, while the setting and supporting cast are vividly drawn.

Eight-time Pro Bowl defensive end, award-winning TV commentator, and action-adventure movie star Howie Long takes you into the huddle and onto the playing field with <i>Football For Dummies</i>, a complete look at all the plays, positions, and penalties of the game, along with plenty of game-day insight and playing-field strategies. <p>Baseball may be America's favorite pastime, says Howie, but football is America's passion.

And what's a gridiron," anyway?) to offensive and defensive plays, armchair quarterbacks, and the art of staying fit, Long tells all. Plus, check out Howie's Part of Tens, with his hits on the ten greatest coaches, offensive and defensive players, and teams of all time -- along with a "Dream Team" roster and complete "Football Speak" glossary.</p></p><p>At last, the Dummies series is tackling football. Former Raider all-pro defensive end and current Fox TV analyst Howie Long calls the signals, and if he doesn't always go deep--he's got a lot of ground to cover--at least he connects. With all its X's and O's, football is a complicated sport, and Long works hard to smooth the way: "Once you break through that initial fear of being overwhelmed by football and what you don't understand," he counsels, "I know everything else about the game, like dominoes, will fall into place." In his role as guide, Long plays those dominoes, from peewees to the pros to the fantasy leagues, explaining positions, analyzing offenses and defenses, and detailing strategies. As with all Dummies guides, the fun part is the "Part of Tens," the series of top-10 lists that dig in for the final chapter. He scores big with his inclusions of John Hannah and Hugh McElhenny among the greatest offensive players ever, but should be penalized for overemphasizing tight ends and forgetting the electricity that wide receivers bring to the game. This, of course, reflects a defensive end's natural bias; since they muck it up more with the hulkier tight ends, they simply let the speedballs fly by. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>"Howie's book has got it all!"

To the east of the peaceful, creative peoples, however, are the patriarchal tribes of the steppes, where women--and life itself--are little valued. Doom is on the way, and lovers from two cultures find themselves in the thick of horror. It is on her coming-of-age day that Marrah finds and rescues the odd-looking stranger who's lying on the beach, almost drowned, after his boat has sunk. Eventually, the language barrier overcome, Marrah learns that this young, blond man, Stavan, is the youngest son of the Great Chief of the Hansi, horsemen and warriors who roam the Sea of Grass, killing and conquering. Marrah is amazed by the Hansi's lack of egalitarian, life-giving values: ``...slaves, wars, concubines...your people sound horrible.'' Yes, indeed, and Stavan warns that they are on the way west. Now, Stavan, in love with Marrah and respecting her people, offers to try to deflect the Great Chief; Marrah and younger brother Arang will also journey--to warn other of the matristic peoples. The journey takes them through welcoming villages, forests, and religious places, but then disaster strikes, and Marrah and Arang are captured. There's an orgy of violence and cruelty, leading to a (literally) graveside escape. Mackey's message concerning patriarchal bloody swords vs. matriarchal plowshares sounds like a rallying trumpet. Certainly the Earth Mother worship--consisting of ``eating well, singing beautifully, enjoying themselves and making love,'' imagined from rose-colored mists of the past--is appealing. Overall: a competent adventure, with characters chatting easily in a modern idiom, for the Bradley/Auel readership. (First printing of 100,000) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

By preference, he likes to walk the reader through a painting or a poem, teasing out the meaning of odd details, making connections with history and other works of art. His must-have essay collections, <i>The Geography of the Imagination</i> and <i>Every Force Evolves a Form</i>, displays his range: With a rainwater clarity, he can write about the naturalistic Louis Aggassiz or ancient poetry and thought . . . He can account for the importance of prehistoric cave art to early modernism or outline the achievements of Joyce and Pound. He can make you yearn to read or look again at neglected masters like the poets Charles Olson and Louis Zukofsky and the painters Balthus and Charles Burchfield. He can send you out eagerly searching for C. M. Doughty's six-volume epic poem, <i>The Dawn in Britain</i>, and for the works of Ronald Johnson, Jonathan Williams and Paul Metcalf.

In discussing seventeenth-century New England culture, it provides a new way of looking at religious belief Hall demonstrates that old ways simply will not do, and he redefines the character of religion and culture in New England. He has written a brilliant book, one that will stimulate its readers for many years. (Robert Middlekauff, University of California, Berkeley)<br><br>In this remarkable book David Hall has carried the study of early New England to new levels of understanding...He shows us, as never before, how the sophisticated doctrines of the Puritan clergy meshed, clashed, and merged with the inherited attitudes and assumptions of ordinary people in their day-to-day grappling with the mysteries of their world. This is a model of historical analysis, not merely for what it tells us about early New England, but also for its brilliant insights into the way religion can operate in society. (Edmund S. Morgan, Yale University)<br><br>David Hall's highly innovative new work...provides close reading, profound insights, and trans-Atlantic comparisons that make this a book of very broad significance and interest. (Michael Kamnien, Cornell University)<br><br>A remarkable work of cultural history...

But in destroying her feelings, she also begins to destroy herself, erasing the girl she'd once been as she inks ravens into her skin. It is only through a series of mysterious encounters -- with a ghostly white dog and a mute boy -- that Green relearns the lessons of love and begins to heal as she tells her own story.</p><p>Alice Hoffman is the bestselling author of Indigo, Aquamarine, The Foretelling, Incantation, and, for adults, Practical Magic and The Third Angel, among many other acclaimed works. Her latest novel is Green Witch. She lives in Massachusetts.Grade 8 Up-Beautifully written prose fills this first-person narrative of a teen whose world is turned around in an instant. This is both a survival story and an homage to the need to cherish life's every moment. Moody, introspective Green, 15, stays at home while her parents and younger sister travel to the city to sell their produce. Her disappointment at being left behind causes her to be cold and not say good-bye. Then the city is engulfed in flames, and ashes hover in the atmosphere for a long time. Green is left with her guilt for her sullen behavior and the solitude of her ruined garden. Hoffman has created a multilayered, believable protagonist. Readers suffer along with her and share her fears as she tries to pick up the pieces of her life. The contrast between her original faith in the promise of the future and her later acknowledgment of the tentative nature of reality is vividly and eloquently portrayed. This is not an easy read, and though it is an absorbing tale, it will most likely appeal to more sophisticated readers.

In this unusually pricey amalgam of biography and autobiography (on which McGee holds sole copyright), Perkins and McGee (a music journalist making his book debut) continually play at that puzzle. Born in 1932 as a sharecropper's son in Tiptonville, Tenn., Perkins had a perfect primary education in American roots music: he grew up picking cotton alongside his family, internalizing field spirituals, and as a teenager made music with his brothers in rough-hewn "tonks." When his "Blue Suede Shoes" single sold a million copies in 1956, Perkins found himself singularly unequipped for stardom: married with two children, he disliked mob scenes and had no PR sense. As the Sun years fade, the narrative spins ever faster: the ten years 1969-1979 are dealt with in as many pages. Ultimately, the Perkins/ McGee collaboration hinders narrative flow, with McGee's third-person prose, full of historical and critical insight, frequently disrupted by Perkins's unilluminating homilies about death, love and self-reliance.

Author tour. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.For deep-dyed fans of the 1950s hybrid of honky-tonk country music and black country blues called rockabilly, no one does it better than Carl Perkins. McGee gives us a compelling life of the guitarist-singer whose "Blue Suede Shoes" is the quintessential rockabilly hit. Perkins epitomizes a phenomenon that has passed into history--the poor farm boy rising to stardom. Born in 1932 to a sharecropping family in west Tennessee, Perkins started picking cotton at age six--and also plucking a guitar. Teen years spent playing in eye-gouging honky-tonks preceded any hit recordings, and then his rocket to stardom was aborted by a car crash that killed his rhythm guitarist--his brother Jay--and sent him deep into the bottle. He kept working, though (famously with Johnny Cash), writing songs McGee praises rather fulsomely, recording prolifically, and raising his family with his one and only wife, Valda. With the help of God, he mastered his alcoholism, which is just one of the stories he tells so well that McGee often turns the narrative entirely over to him. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Shadowplay: Shadowmarch Volume II</h2><p>A year ago, the March Kingdoms were at peace, and the Eddon family held the throne.

She lives in Brighton, England.</p><b>Chapter One</b> <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Self-Portrait, with dinosaurs <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>At night I would often be woken by noise from the road, and afterward would lie awake for hours, unable to sleep. The noise, which was of a strange drunken revelry, would usually begin long after the pubs had closed, though in the deeps of the night I never knew exactly what time it was. I was merely summoned by the sound of unearthly groans and shrieks outside my window that seemed to belong neither to the world nor to my dreams but somewhere in between. They might have been men&#x2019;s voices or women&#x2019;s, it was hard to tell. The noise they made came from a region that outlay human identity. Their long, inchoate monologues, vocalized yet senseless, seemed to name something that afterward could not be specified, to describe what by daylight appeared indescribable. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>This demoniacal groaning would often go on for so long that it seemed impossible it could be coming from living people passing on the pavements. It was the sound of lost souls, of primitive creatures bellowing far inside the earth. Yet I never got up to look: the noise was so unreal that it was only when it stopped that I felt myself to be actually awake. Then I would lie there, full of a feeling of insecurity, as though the world were a wildly spinning fairground ride from which my bed might work loose and be somehow flung away. The groaning sounds and the darkness and the carelessly spinning earth, offering me its fathomless glimpses of space, of nothingness: all this would run on for one hour or two or three, I couldn&#x2019;t tell.The hours were blank and sealed, filled with gray information: one after another they were dispatched. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Then another sound would begin, dimly at first, a kind of humming or droning, steady and industrious. After a while it filled the room with its monotonous note. This was the sound of traffic. People were going in their cars to work. A little later a finger of wan light showed itself at the curtains. When I was a child the night seemed as big as an ocean to me, deep and static: you rowed across it for hour after hour and sometimes got so lost in time and darkness that it seemed as if the morning might never be found. Now it was a mere vacuum, filling up with human activity as a dump is filled with discarded objects. It was an empty space into which the overcrowded world was extending its outskirts, its sprawl. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>We were living in Bristol at that time, and the slaving past of the city was always present to me, though in the middle-class district of Clifton its brutality was largely semantic, recalling itself amid the boutiques and sofa shops of Whiteladies Road and Blackboys Hill. Yet it seemed to have seeped into the masonry, into the paving stones. I was often told that thebeautiful Georgian terraces of Clifton had for years been neglected and threatened with demolition and that students and artists had lived there contentedly in conditions approximating squalor. But that was in the past: these days the slave owners&#x2019; houses were smart again and unaffordable, the streets lined with beauty salons and expensive cars, the baize lawns of the private schools trodden by millionaires&#x2019; children from China, America, Japan. Clifton estate agents carried themselves with the preening significance of royal courtiers, while the fume-throttled city sprawled below, with its bombed-out center, its ghettos, its miles of strange, impoverished housing, its uneasy atmosphere both of misrule and of a thorough-minded, inexorable division. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Something of the hard-heartedness of that imperial past seemed to live on in the people I met and spoke to every day. Man, woman, and child, they found sensitivity intolerable. Nothing irked them more than the liberal conscience, unless it was anoutspoken sense of injustice. These things impinged on their free bigotry, and on the sense of humor that depended on it. They were not cold or unfriendly; quite the reverse. It was just that their philosophy formed an edifice of startling indelicacy amid the fluted columns and porticoes, the classical perspectives and cloudlike silhouettes, the ancient parks and pavilions, the secret rotundas and rich, ornamented interiors that were their habitat. It was a philosophy composed of two primitive blocks: that everyone should work for what he had; and that what mattered were the good things in life. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Encompassing so little in and of itself, this was a philosophy that required, for the sake of texture, of content, a God&#x2014;and indeed the churches of Clifton did a thriving trade, on the import and the export side alike. I encountered notionsof Christian charity that might have come from the pages of a Victorian novel, so ignorant did they seem of the concept of social democracy, and was beleaguered everywhere by advertisements for the evangelical Alpha course, which, for an initiative that targets those who have lost their way in life, seemed in Clifton to be remarkably well attended. These advertisements took a somewhat startling form: one day I passed one and was driven to stop and look at it twice. It was a photograph ofa man in climbing equipment standing in sunlight on the pinnacle of a mountain. I was surprised, almost affronted, by the caption, which read: Is there more to life than this? I wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure there was, nor ought to be. But I pondered it all the same. It had a profound effect on me, though not quite the one it intended. Whenever I thought of it, I feltmyself drawing to the threshold of a revelation, a realization so large that it was difficult to see its full extent. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Down in the city, the turgid river creeps between its sludge-gray banks. The Avon Gorge rises steeply to either side. A busy road runs down it: the roar of traffic echoes all along the chasm, rising and revolving like a vortex. Once there were mammoths here, and bears, and strange swimming dinosaurs with pointed beaks and close-set eyes. There is a placard by the gorge with drawings of these creatures, and a timeline. It is as straight as a ruler: it runs through the Paleolithic and the Neolithic and the Jurassic, through ice ages colored blue. At the end there is the stub of humanity, smaller than an arrowhead on its long shaft of time. Where it is going nobody knows. The line stops: the future is blank. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Every day at the same time I leave the house and walk my children to school. They are five and six. They each wear a navy-blue uniform, and carry a nylon schoolbag of the same color. These things identify them, just as in their picture books the Romans are identified by their togas, the Victorians by their bustles and top hats. They are modern schoolchildren: they belong to their moment in history, which gathers them up in its great impersonal wave. Now and then they make a toga out of asheet, or dress up in the crumpled raiment of an Indian squaw that lies with other costumes in a chest in their room. In the dim light of an English winter in an English provincial city, the forms of other eras vaguely suggest themselves, like mountains in mist. But none of it obstructs the passage of the arrow that flies on and on into its endlessly repeating blankness. They go to school and come back again, go and come back, go and come back. They are happy enough to do it, though theyretain a certain neutrality, as though they have been promised an explanation and are patiently waiting for it to be given. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It is on their behalf that I nurture my deepest stores of repulsion for the God advertisement and its insolent question. Ifthere are to be lies, let them not concern the value of life, for not everyone has tired of it yet. Let them not denigrate the world, for there are those whose chance to see it has not yet come. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>On New Year&#x2019;s Eve we go to a party on Dartmoor. In the morning I wake in an unfamiliar bedroom and look through the window at the moor veiled with rain. The shrouded hills are desolate. They seem to extend on and on, into an indistinct kind of infinity. After breakfast the women sit on sofas, talking. Their children dart in and out. Sometimes they reach out and catchone, to hold its squirming body and stroke its bright, fine hair. Their female forms are fixed and sculptural: though the children squirm, they are glad to be held by something so firm. The women are both shelter and shrine&#x2014;they offer and at the same time they ask. They have agreed to stay still: it is the children who choose, between security and risk. It is important that they choose correctly. They mustn&#x2019;t cling to their mothers; nor must they forget to swim past, close enough to be caught. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I stare through the window. From here it looks as though you could walk into the vista of gray hills and never stop, walk and walk without ever reaching anything you could call by its name. In time we decided to leave Clifton and move elsewhere. Our friends were sorry to see us go. They did not believe that we would find a place we liked better, for it seemed obviousto them that we were afflicted with restlessness and with a love of the unknown that in their eyes was a kind of curse, like the curses in mythology that are forever sending people from their homes to seek what perhaps can never be found, for it is in the seeking itself that the punishment lies. Yet I had a terror of my own, which was the fear of knowing somethinginits entirety. To seek held no particular fear for me: it was to find, and to know, and to come to the end of knowing thatIshrank from. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Go we must: go we would. But where? In the novels I read, people were forever disappearing off to Italy at a moment&#x2019;s notice, to wait out unpropitious seasons o...</p><h2>Still Life: Adventures in Taxidermy</h2><p><p>It's easy to dismiss taxidermy as a kitschy or morbid sideline, the realm of trophy fish and jackalopes or an anachronistic throwback to the dusty diorama.

With <em>Still Life</em>, Melissa Milgrom peels the skin back on Norman Bates's favorite pastime, dutifully tracking taxidermy from its 19th-century heyday (the beneficiary of a natural history boom), to its nadir as a reviled predilection in the age of PETA and conservation. It will tell most readers as much as they need to know about erosion-molded rats and replacement lips, ears, and eyelids, but it's the culture of iron-stomached men (and occasionally, women) that practice the art of skinned carcasses and stretched hides--those who wield "the calipers and the brain spoons"--that Milgrom's after. Beginning as a wide-eyed visitor to a third-generation stuff shop, she moves through an underworld of auctions, artisans, scientists, and the ultra competitive (albeit insular) World Taxidermy Championships, ultimately trying a queasy hand at squirrel-stuffing herself. <em>Still Life</em> an entertaining and illuminating adventure. <em>--Jon Foro</em><br> <br> <br> <p><b>Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Melissa Milgrom, Author of <i>Still Life: Adventures in Taxidermy</i></b></p> <p></p> <p>Dear Amazon Reader,</p> <p>People--even my own parents!--ask what sparked my interest in taxidermy. I tell them that in 1994 I went on a safari gone awry, which led me to the family workshop of the last chief taxidermist of the American Museum of Natural History. I was expecting him to be creepy like Norman Bates in <i>Psycho</i>, but he was a gentle naturalist, and his studio with its skeletons and birds, the beauty and the strange tools, evoked Darwin's study. The contradiction pulled me in, and still does.</p> <p><i>Still Life</i> took more than six years to write and that's because I had to shift my perception from one of skepticism to one of empathy and respect. I just saw <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i> and thought if Wes Anderson had been alive in the 1850s he'd have been a Victorian taxidermist, making little scenes of kittens dressed as brides. It's ironic--Victorians needed taxidermy to see exotic species from other continents, and we need taxidermists for the same reason--we long for animals as they disappear. Taxidermy evokes grandeur, which may help us comprehend the present mass extinction.</p> <p>Another reason I find taxidermy engrossing is because it combines art, science, and hunting. In <i>Still Life</i> I shadowed the most gifted taxidermist I could find in each area: an artist, a field naturalist, and a hunter, each of whom is on a quest to understand nature on its own terms. English sculptor Emily Mayer preserves animals for Damien Hirst's most provocative artworks; her dogs are so boggling you have to poke them to see if they will move. Ken Walker, the hunter from Alberta who recreates extinct species, is self-taught. He won the World Taxidermy Championships three times and was a Roy Orbison impersonator, which actually makes perfect sense. Taxidermy is like karaoke. The person who loves the singer the most gets the voice right.</p> <p>I hope you will enjoy the people you meet in <i>Still Life</i> whose obsessions and uncannily lifelike replicas create an art form that once was sublime and may be again.</p> <i>Melissa Milgrom</i><p></p> <p>(Photo � Ulalume Zavala)</p> <br> <br> <p> <b>A Look Inside the World Taxidermy Championships with Author Melissa Milgrom</b><br><b>(Click to Enlarge)</b> </p> <p></p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ken Walker's Panda "Thing Thing"--recreated from bear skins-- Best of Show Recreations 2003</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br> <br><b>"Who knew a book about dead animals could be so lively?</b> This is a wonderful look at a quirky, passionate, sometimes fanatical subculture." <b>&#x2014;A.J.

In <i>Buck Up, Suck Up... and Come Back When You Foul Up</i>, the two lay out 12 of the rules they developed while separately and jointly masterminding some of the hottest political races in recent years. And with entertaining and enlightening behind-the-scenes anecdotes drawn from both effective and futile experiences along the campaign trail--most notably their work with Bill Clinton during his two presidential terms--Begala and Carville present a practical course that can be followed in business as well as politics. "If the audience you're trying to reach is smaller than the one hundred million voters we spend our time trying to reach," they write, "we believe these lessons are even more important because your target audience is even more sophisticated, even more interested, even more up-to-the-minute." <p> At first glance, some rules appear blatantly obvious ("Don't Quit," "Turn Weakness into Strength") and some intentionally controversial ("Kiss Ass," "Know How to Recover When You Really Screw Up"). But, in their explanations, the relevancy and potential application of each consistently comes through. For example, in "Frame the Debate," they note how Ronald Reagan controlled the agenda in his 1980 challenge to Jimmy Carter through early attacks on the incumbent's most unpopular policies--showing precisely why "military strategists know that most battles are won ... by the side that determines where, when and how an engagement is fought." Likewise, in "Know How to Communicate," they bring five tips (tell a story, be brief, be emotional, be unique, be relevant) to life by explaining how their use aided campaigns for Hillary Clinton, Tony Blair, and others. The result, while perhaps too profane for some and definitely not Republican-friendly despite its grudging acknowledgment of a few masterful GOP performances, is nonetheless uniformly readable and genuinely practical. <i>--Howard Rothman</i></p><b>James Carville</b> and <b>Paul Begala</b> have been a political team since 1983. Their first campaign together was the worst Democratic defeat in the history of the state they were working in. They recovered, regrouped and went on a five-year winning streak that caught the attention of the talented young governor in Arkansas. From that effort came the War Room, a new way to run political campaigns that has been studied around the world and was the basis of the Academy Award-nominated documentary.</p><h2>Stone Mattress</h2><p><b>In Margaret Atwood's stunning new collection of stories, her first since her #1 nationally bestselling 2006 collection, <i>Moral Disorder</i>, she returns to the here and now in this brilliant, new collection of stories.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these nine dazzlingly inventive and rewarding stories, Margaret Atwood's signature dark humour, playfulness, and deadly seriousness are in abundance. In "Freeze-Dried Bridegroom," a man who bids on a storage locker has a surprise. In "Lusus Naturae," a woman with a genetic abnormality is mistaken for a vampire. In "I Dream of Zenia with the Bright Red Teeth," we remeet Tony, Charis, and Roz from <i>The Robber Bride</i>, but, years later, as their nemesis is seen in an unexpected form. In "Torching the Dusties," an elderly lady with Charles Bonnet's syndrome comes to terms with the little people she keeps seeing, while a newly formed populist group gathers to burn down her retirement residence.

He&#39;d blown the whistle on a gang of rogue cops and was awaiting the day when Internal Affairs would call him to testify and help put their leader, Lieutenant Matty Fagan, behind bars. His cover was working as a doorman in a luxury highrise on Chicago&#39;s lakefront. Then Gabby Fairbanks and her husband moved into the building&#39;s penthouse. She brought home a bag lady, got a job at the Manna House Women&#39;s Shelter, found her life falling apart, and managed to entangle Harry in the whole affair. (Gabby&#39;s story is in Neta Jackson&#39;s parallel novel, WHERE DO I GO?) But there was an upside. Through Gabby, Harry meets the Yada Yada brothers and the classy Estelle Williams and envisions a second chance at romance. The Yada Yada brothers provide a new circle of friends to replace his old CPD cohorts. But when Harry discovers he has a grandson he didn&#39;t know about, will he find the faith to take on the boy as a &#34;second chance&#34; to be the father he&#39;d failed to be to his own son-even when the boy creates new dangers in Harry&#39;s fight against corruption, and may derail his &#34;second chance&#34; at love? Dave Jackson and his wife, Neta, are the award-winning authors of the 40-volume Trailblazer series. The phenomenal popularity of Neta&#39;s Yada Yada Prayer Group series inspired them to write &#34;parallel&#34; spin-off novels, two stories taking place in the same context ... just the way it happens in real life. They live in the Chicago area, where these stories are set.</p><p></p><h2>Modern Furniture Projects (Best of Fine Woodworking)</h2><p><p>This text helps you to design and make furniture in the modern style.

But when he wasn't painting covers and making drawings for <i>The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Time,</i> and <i>Rolling Stone</i>, he was making comic strips. Sorel's strips are iconoclastic, cynical, and universally excoriating. No target escapes his watchful wrath: politicians, theological dynasties, idealogues left and right, lawyers, publishers, and the usual gang of movers and shakers (nor does he spare himself). Culled from the pages of <i>The Nation</i>, the <i>Village Voice, Penthouse</i>, and other magazines, Sorel proves he is that most dangerous of creatures - a cartoonist with a chip on his shoulder. <br></p><p>Edward Sorel is one of America&#x2019;s finest artists and satirists.

A small band of dissidents, including a one-armed computer jock, a radical young woman, a past-his-prime academic and a nearly omnipotent computer named Mike, ignite the fires of revolution despite the near certainty of failure and death.Winner of the 1967 Hugo award, this novel marked Heinlein's partial return to his best form. He draws many historical parallels with the War of Independence, and clearly shows his own libertarian political views.<p>In what is considered one of his most hair-raising, thought-provoking and outrageous adventures, the master of modern SF tells the strange story of an even stranger world -- 21st century Luna, a harsh penal colony where a revolt is plotted between a bashful computer and a ragtag collection of maverick humans.

From the fishing boat in which he stands, he begins: &#34;He who has ears to hear, let him hear . . .&#34; And the words that follow are like none you&#39;ve ever heard. All over Palestine his simples stories and tales -- his parables -- have changed lives: Pharisees, prostitutes, tax-collectors, his own followers, and all the poor and dispirited of Palestine. Come, sit at the table with the Pharisee and hear Jesus tell the story of two men who borrowed money from a money-lender. Mingle with the lawyers and ponder what Jesus means when he tells them about a Samaritan who comes to the aid of an injured man on the roadside. Pray in the temple between the publican and the Pharisee as each of them prays to God. Instructive Moments with the Savior brings freshness and renewed insight to the parables of Jesus. It is ideal reading for morning or night or whenever you need to spend a few moments with the Savior.

In the end, the life of the man best known for writing Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s biography was something of a patchwork affair. As Johnson himself understood: &#x201c;That creature was its own tormentor, and I believe its name was BOSWELL.&#x201d;</p><p>Few periods in Boswell&#x2019;s life better crystallize this internal turmoil than 1763&#x2013;1765, the years of his Grand Tour and the focus of Robert Zaretsky&#x2019;s thrilling intellectual adventure. From the moment Boswell sailed for Holland from the port of Harwich, leaving behind on the beach his newly made friend Dr. Johnson, to his return to Dover from Calais a year and a half later, the young Scot was intent on not just touring historic and religious sites but also canvassing the views of the greatest thinkers of the age. In his relentless quizzing of Voltaire and Rousseau, Hume and Johnson, Paoli and Wilkes on topics concerning faith, the soul, and death, he was not merely a celebrity-seeker but&#x2015;for want of a better term&#x2015;a truth-seeker. Zaretsky reveals a life more complex and compelling than suggested by the label &#x201c;Johnson&#x2019;s biographer,&#x201d; and one that 250 years later registers our own variations of mind.</p></p><p>Robert Zaretsky is a literary biographer and historian of France. He is Professor of Humanities at the Honors College, University of Houston, and the author of many books, including <i>A Life Worth Living: Albert Camus and the Quest for Meaning</i> and <i>Boswell&#x2019;s Enlightenment</i>. Zaretsky is the history editor for the <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>, a regular columnist for <i>The Forward,</i> and a frequent contributor to the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Foreign Policy</i>, and <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>.&#x201c;The key theme of <b>Robert Zaretsky</b>&#x2019;s splendid new book on James Boswell is that his life was a roaming drama of self-discovery... <i>Boswell&#x2019;s Enlightenment</i> is thus about the art of living. Boswell&#x2019;s interest for the historian lies not with the originality of his thought&#x2015;there was none&#x2015;but as an example of someone who struggled, Zaretsky shows, &#x2018;to bend his person to certain philosophical ends.&#x2019; Hume, Johnson, Rousseau and Voltaire were asked to help him divine what those ends might be. Zaretsky&#x2019;s elegantly written book, then, stands alongside a growing literature&#x2015;including the works of Pierre Hadot (<i>Philosophy as a Way of Life</i>) and Alexander Nehemas (<i>The Art of Living</i>)&#x2013;that renders the history of philosophy not as an academic pursuit, but as something wrought in pursuit of the common good.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gavin Jacobson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Zaretsky</b>&#x2019;s buoyant and rigorous &#x2018;intellectual adventure&#x2019; is a successful attempt to place the writer within the broad tapestry of the European Enlightenment...In Zaretsky&#x2019;s book, we see the effect of one great mind upon another, again and again, and thus we see the evolution of Boswell&#x2019;s dazzling prose style.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andrew O&#x2019;Hagan</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Enthralling...<i>Boswell&#x2019;s Enlightenment</i> proves that the world&#x2019;s greatest biographer makes a fascinating subject in his own right.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Josh Emmons</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;During his life, Boswell was known more for his associations than for his accomplishments, but it&#x2019;s time, historian <b>Robert Zaretsky</b> thinks, to give him his moment in the spotlight...Zaretsky&#x2019;s telling is as much an intellectual history as it is a coming-of-age tale, though one gets the sense that Boswell never quite came of age... Zaretsky&#x2019;s account of this conflicted man is a sympathetic, fluid, and very enjoyable read. We see a man in search not so much of wisdom as of seekers of wisdom. As much as he tried, Boswell never became an in�tellectual equal with the great think�ers of his day, but as an observer of them (and of himself) he had no peer.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Nolan</b><b>, </b><b><i>First Things</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Entertaining... [<b>Zaretsky</b>] put[s] Boswell forward as, among other things, a harbinger of our own day, a living symbol of a transition from the high-minded ideals of a more pure intellectual world to the self-centered obsessions of day-to-day reality.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steven Donoghue</b><b>, </b><b><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Engaging...<i>Boswell&#x2019;s Enlightenment</i> is a readable, smart, accessible introduction to a self-absorbed but likable young man who reminds us the Age of Enlightenment was also the Age of Exuberance.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Fritz Lanham</b><b>, </b><b><i>Houston Chronicle</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;James Boswell, best known as Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s biographer, was a lifelong seeker of truth. He struggled to put together his Calvinist religious heritage with the insights and perspectives of the Enlightenment. From 1763 to 1765 he toured Europe not just to see the historic sites but to encounter some of its greatest living thinkers, among them Rousseau and Voltaire. <b>Zaretsky</b> adroitly chronicles Boswell&#x2019;s intellectual journey and introduces the reader to the varieties of 18th-century Enlightenment. Boswell&#x2019;s struggles remain with us&#x2015;over the relationship between faith and reason, the nature of human liberty and equality, the duties of citizenship, the role and limits of the state, and what constitutes the good life.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Christian Century</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Zaretsky</b> believes Boswell was an exceptional talent, notwithstanding his weaknesses, and certainly worthy of our attention. Glossing several periods of Boswell&#x2019;s life but closely examining his grand tour of the Continent (1763-1765), Zaretsky elevates Boswell&#x2019;s station, repairs Boswell&#x2019;s literary reputation, and corrects a longstanding underestimation, calling attention to his complicated and curious relationship to the Enlightenment, a movement or milieu that engulfed him without necessarily defining him...Bristling with the animated, ambulatory prose of the old style of literary and historical criticism, the kind that English professors disdain but educated readers enjoy and appreciate.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Allen Mendenhall</b><b>, </b><b><i>Liberty Unbound</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;James Boswell (1740-1795) comes to life in <b>Zaretsky</b>&#x2019;s recounting of his European grand tour in the mid-18th-century... Zaretsky introduces the Enlightenment greats who taught and molded Boswell. The vast store of knowledge our traveler absorbed in so few years makes for truly enlightening reading... This wonderful rendering of Boswell digs deep into his probing, enquiring life and the fast friends he made at every turn.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This sparkling work is a partial biography of one of the 18th century&#x2019;s most arresting figures&#x2015;someone often taken to be emblematic of that intellectually critical era. <b>Zaretsky</b> sees James Boswell&#x2015;known for &#x2018;his oddness, his youth, and his melancholy&#x2019;&#x2015;as embodying the Enlightenment&#x2019;s many conflicting currents and torn by them all. Seeking to escape from conflicts between the flesh and Protestant religiosity, and between the ancient and modern, the young Scot sought and gained the acquaintance and counsel, much of it unsettling to him, of some of the age&#x2019;s great figures&#x2015;Samuel Johnson, Voltaire, Rousseau, David Hume, John Wilkes, and Pascal Paoli&#x2015;in a famous two-year tour of the Continent. Boswell&#x2019;s earnest search for answers to life&#x2019;s bewildering puzzles continues to fascinate. Zaretsky brilliantly, sometimes movingly, adds to that fascination... So convincing are Zaretsky&#x2019;s observations, so sure his touch.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><h2>A Place of Quiet Rest: Finding Intimacy With God Through a Daily Devotional Life</h2><p>Daily time with the Lord Jesus is essential for an authentic relationship with Him.

The author of King Kong and the Willy stories again features anthropomorphic chimps, who provide four unique perspectives: an uppity, overbearing mother and her glum son, Charles; and an unemployed fellow and his cheerful daughter, Smudge. What transpires factually is simple: the two children play together, their dogs do the same, the adults keep to themselves. Yet Browne reinvents and overlays the scene as each parent and child in turn describes their version of the events, altering light, colors and words. Browne sets up the tension by starting off with Charles's stylishly dressed mother, who lets her "pedigree Labrador," Victoria, off the leash and then scoffs at "some scruffy mongrel"(Smudge's dog). The matriarch similarly describes Charles's newfound friend as "a very rough-looking child." Through Charles's eyes, readers watch the tops of lampposts, gray clouds and a leafless tree take on the shape of his mother's large chapeau, as her hat-dominated figure casts a shadow over the boy. In the succeeding page, Browne cleverly frames a shift in Charles's mood with an illustration divided by a lamppost: threatening clouds and bare trees give way to blue skies and blossoming branches when a smiling, pigtailed (anything but rough-looking) Smudge on the sunny side of the park bench invites Charles to play on the slide. Browne offers readers much to pore over. His images reflect the human psyche; some are eerie (Edvard Munch's "The Scream" appears in the want ads; a burning tree provides the backdrop for mother and son's silent exit from the park), others uplifting. For example, the subjects of two portraits leaning on the park wall, a gloomy Rembrandt self-portrait and a weeping Mona Lisa, transform into a dancing couple under a street lamp fashioned from a flower, as the jobless man departs the park, cheered by his daughter. Although some discomfiting tonesAin both pictures and textA appear in the vignettes, Browne also celebrates the redeeming power of connecting with another human being. His creativity invites youngsters to tap into their own, as they look for clues between the trees and add their own spins to Browne's four interconnected tales.

From <em>Black Feeling, Black Talk and Black Judgment</em> in the 1960s to <em>Bicycles </em>in 2010, Giovanni&#x2019;s poetry has influenced literary figures from James Baldwin to Blackalicious, and touched millions of readers worldwide. In <em>Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea</em>, Giovanni turns her gaze toward the state of the world around her, and offers a daring, resonant look inside her own self as well.<br></p><p><p>When Nikki Giovanni's poems first emerged during the Civil Rights and Black Arts Movements of the 1960s, she immediately took a place among the most celebrated and influential poets of the era. Now, Giovanni continues to stand as one of the most commanding, luminous voices to grace America's political and poetic landscape.</p> <p>In a career spanning over thirty years, Giovanni has created a body of work that's become vital and essential to our American consciousness. This collection of new poems is a masterpiece that explores the ecstatic union between self and community. <em>Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea</em> is an extraordinarily intimate collection. Each poem bears our revered cultural icon's trademark of the unfalteringly political and the intensely personal: The elegant "What We Miss" exalts the might and grace of women, while "Swinging on a Rainbow" rejoices about the spaces in which we read; Giovanni commemorates Africa and her family legacy in the majestic "Symphony of the Sphinx" and contemplates our America in the heartbreaking "Desperate Acts" and "9:11:01 He Blew It." And in the dreamy "Making James Baldwin" and dazzling "Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea," Giovanni gives us reason to comfort, to share, to love, to change and to be human. </p><p><em>Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea</em> is Nikki Giovanni's meditation on humanity and soul. It's her revelatory gaze at the world in which we live -- and her confession on the world she dreams we <em>will</em> one day call home. Nikki Giovanni is a national treasure as she once again confirms her place as one of America's most powerful truth tellers and beloved daughters.</p><p>Nikki Giovanni, poet, activist, mother, and professor, is a seven-time NAACP Image Award winner and the first recipient of the Rosa Parks Woman of Courage Award, and holds the Langston Hughes Medal for Outstanding Poetry, among many other honors.

My furniture and boxes, enough to fill a few rooms--but not enough to weigh me down--were the last loaded into the huge van that pulled up to my old place. First in, first out.</p><p>They place things where I want them and assemble my dining table and bed in thirty minutes. The house isn&#x2019;t much bigger than my apartment was, and with an extra bedroom and a garage, my belongings hardly dent the space. The van rumbles off to meet the next wanderers, and I take my first real breath since I gave strangers access to my possessions.</p><p>My running shoes are near the top of my suitcase. I ditch my flip-flops and tie the laces quickly. The first thing most people do when they complete a move is unpack the bedsheets or locate the coffeemaker. Not me. What convinces me I can start over again is reminding myself that when the time comes, I&#x2019;ll still know how to run.</p><p>I drop my key in my pocket and stretch only a moment before beginning a slow jog along a circle drive that borders the neighborhood of midcentury homes, with mine at the back. The air is thick with the heady scent of flowers, and lush, dense grass covers lawns instead of the usual pale stubble of late summer. After crisscrossing the country a few times, I worried that returning to Texas in August would be depressing. Everyone has a different theory about the record-breaking rain this year. I&#x2019;m just happy to see color. The morning humidity, though, has me dripping before I even pick up my pace, and breathing takes extra effort.</p><p>At the edge of the neighborhood, I pause. A park is visible from my new backyard. It&#x2019;s the last quiet weekend of the year. Soon, it will teem with students playing intramurals, studying, or socializing, instead of the solitude I seek this morning. It&#x2019;s a good day to explore.</p><p>The park is small, and thick with trees. Only a few paved paths connect the busy roads and a parking lot, and it takes no time to run the length each way. On my second circuit, I cut through a playing field near the back edge to see how vulnerable my yard is. The campus police patrol the park and nearby neighborhoods, but now that I see how secluded the area is, I&#x2019;m relieved my wood fence is in good repair. Fortunately, an even taller industrial fence makes it nearly impossible to access it from the field. My windows and yard aren&#x2019;t visible at all.</p><p>I slow my pace, cool down as much as the humidity allows, then walk, taking a long draw on my water bottle.</p><p>The sun is at the treetops now, and the sound of traffic is increasing, but still muffled by huge oaks. I walk toward the far corner of the park, curious what lies beyond in the dusky woods. I&#x2019;m surprised to find another grassy area surrounded by a simple chain-link fence. It&#x2019;s a small cemetery, memorial stones scattered here and there--an odd discovery in this modern-day park. Perhaps early settlers buried their dead here, and the city graciously fenced the space instead of incorporating it into the park.</p><p>A historical marker catches my eye near the gate. I struggle to read it in the early-morning light. Site of Berachah Home and Cemetery . . .</p><p>The Berachah Rescue Society was organized at Waco in 1894 by the Rev. J. T. Upchurch (b. 1870) for the protection of homeless girls and unwed mothers. Nine years later, he opened the Berachah Industrial Home at this site. Ten buildings were located here, including a print shop for publication of The Purity Journal. The cemetery, which contains more than eighty graves, was first used in 1904 . . .</p><p>Eighty graves? It hardly looks big enough. Before I can finish reading the plaque, though, my gaze is drawn to movement inside the fence. A young woman lies flat in the grass, raven hair splayed against the green. She gazes straight up beneath a tall, jagged tree near the edge of the graveyard. Gray and leafless, the tree appears to be dead--for years--perhaps struck by lightning. It&#x2019;s split nearly straight down the middle.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to startle her, but I worry, in spite of an intense desire to leave well enough alone. Is she ill? Injured? Or just resting?</p><p>Suddenly, though, she stretches to stand, retrieves an overstuffed bag, and exits the cemetery without a word or even a glance in my direction. I shiver as she disappears beyond the dark canopy of trees.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not superstitious. I don&#x2019;t believe any place or person is haunted by anything but the past. But suddenly, that old saying about a ghost walking over a grave crosses my mind.</p><p>And suddenly, I can&#x2019;t wait to get home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lizzie Bates</p><p>Tyler, Texas</p><p>Fall 1904</p><p>The two ladies dressed all in white hovered over where Lizzie and Docie lay huddled in a fetid pile of rags, and she thought it was angels come, finally, to take them away up to heaven. Her heart quickened. She&#x2019;d figured on the Lord forgetting her and her girl--or maybe just turning his back.</p><p>Keys clinked as the jail keeper unlocked his steel cage, shoved into a corner of the room, with rusting shelves for bunks in each half. They were alone in it but for a man sleeping off drink on the other side. The angels bent inside to whisper over her and Docie. Now she feared they&#x2019;d take her girl but leave her to die alone and suffer eternal hell. She wouldn&#x2019;t have blamed the Lord for thinking to do it that way, for Docie was surely not liable for her mother&#x2019;s sins. Even if Lizzie was not worthy, her Docie was innocence itself, though her tiny body was riddled with the same sick. The child slept at her teat whenever they were together, but Lizzie couldn&#x2019;t bear to think what might have befallen Docie when she couldn&#x2019;t watch her every minute of the day and night. Either way, Lizzie was to blame. She had let her down so many ways.</p><p>No more. She wouldn&#x2019;t let anyone, heavenly or not, snatch her girl without a struggle. She sat as high as the metal above her head allowed and wrapped her arms around Docie. The little girl flirted with waking, but her exhaustion was plain, and she slumped against her mother, cheeks fever red and dark lashes scarcely visible against the purple smudges beneath her eyes. Docie could not fight; it was up to her mother to see that they remained together.</p><p>But the angel ladies didn&#x2019;t move to take Docie. They only stooped to look, speaking hushed words Lizzie couldn&#x2019;t plainly make out. The swirling in her head and burning in her throat made it too hard to ask their intentions. Perhaps she had not moved to gather Docie closer after all. Perhaps she had simply wished it. Or, perhaps Docie was already close, as she should be.</p><p>Lizzie caught scraps of what they said, and the jailer&#x2019;s voice rose as he described their history and condition. How they both suffered from a foul disease. How Lizzie had earned her keep out at the county farm lately, cooking for the Negro inmates. How the farm superintendent had taken her into his own shack to live in sin, feeding her heroin to subdue her, and then passed her to the chain gang boss when he tired of her. How she&#x2019;d taken sick, and it crippled her so badly she couldn&#x2019;t stand. And finally, how they&#x2019;d sent her and Docie to the jail, no regard for whether they lived or died.</p><p>Her skin crawled. Damn the farm boss. While many around her had been hooked on dope for years, she&#x2019;d managed to keep off it until he&#x2019;d sensed her desperation. Then she took it gladly.</p><p>But she hadn&#x2019;t needed subduing, not like a wild animal.</p><p>She&#x2019;d needed to forget.</p><p>Lizzie had lived hand-to-mouth as long as the jailer had known of her, a decade or more, drifting in and out of town, lately only with her girl, but for years with her people--a no-good cracker and his half-Injun wife. Docie, a wispy towhead with skin so milky the blue showed through, had piercing, near-black eyes from Choctaw still running in those veins, same as her ma and granny.</p><p>Lizzie marveled at all the jailer knew from his tenure of locking her up when she had nowhere else to go. One thing they were all sure of: She and Docie weren&#x2019;t long for this world. One or both would slip away soon, with or without angels to guide them. To hear him say it plain was a comfort. She was weary of fighting for a place for her and Docie on this earth.</p><p>The women gasped at the jail keeper&#x2019;s speech. Had they come only to eye her condition? Society ladies who wanted to witness the scum at the bottom to comfort themselves? Then they could return to their pillowy houses to preach the perils of drink and heroin and impurity. She shrugged. If she could be a warning, she reckoned her life had some sliver of purpose after all.</p><p>She cowered when one lady inched closer to kneel near the pile of shredded bedding.</p><p>&#x201c;You poor dear. We&#x2019;re from the King&#x2019;s Daughters. The jailer&#x2019;s wife asked if we&#x2019;d take you and your little one to a place we know--a wonderful new home for young women where you could find healing and comfort, Lord willing.&#x201d;</p><p>Now Lizzie grinned. Maybe, instead, the lady was a haint! Who&#x2019;d suggest such a thing?</p><p>But the woman stretched her ungloved hand to touch Lizzie&#x2019;s shoulder, and Lizzie felt it, warm and firm, and next, the back of Docie&#x2019;s head, unafraid of the pus-filled sores on their skin or what clouded Lizzie&#x2019;s vision until it was near impossible to make out the woman&#x2019;s features.</p><p>Tears cut a path through the crusted grime on her cheeks. She nodded, then fell into a stupor, blissfully free of nightmares.</p></p><h2>The Phish Book</h2><p>Having played more than a thousand shows and recorded ten albums during their fifteen years together, Phish now brings us a different kind of performance--a written one. The first and only authorized book about the band, The Phish Book is an extraordinary verbal and visual chronicle of a year in the life of Phish, featuring extensive interviews with the four band members--Trey Anastasio, Jon Fishman, Mike Gordon, and Page McConnell--conducted by writer Richard Gehr, who also serves as guide to the history, mythology, musical context, and unique audience-band relationship in which the Vermont quartet flourishes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it contains many of the trappings of other lavish rock monuments--including more than two hundred pieces of previously unpublished art and photography from the band's private archive--The Phish Book elevates the form by means of an innovative roundtable-style discussion format. Richard Gehr and Phish use the events of 1997 as a jumping-off point from which the band members free-associate about themselves, their music, and the dedicated and colorful community that springs up wherever they perform.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the backstage scene at Boston's Fleet Center on New Year's Eve, 1996, The Phish Book explores the band's earliest days in Burlington, Vermont; their musical influences, which include James Brown, Frank Zappa, and the Grateful Dead; their legendary Halloween shows; the two European and two American tours the group undertook in 1997; the stories behind their 1996 studio album, Billy Breathes, and the following year's live Slip Stitch and Pass; life onstage and off; the sixty-thousand-fan Maine campout and art project known as the Great Went; and the experimental recording and performing techniques that informed the band's most recent studio album, The Story of the Ghost.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a retrospective journal of the group's evolution, The Phish Book is a glorious snapshot of a band much bigger than its parts and at the height of its collective power.</p><p>With pride, drummer Jon Fishman explains the level of success that his quirky, experimental roots-rock quartet has achieved: "We've reached the point where it's cool to hate us." As you might expect from this eclectic band, such a metric speaks louder than the legions of Phish fans that follow the quartet from town to town.<p> Cowriter Richard Gehr describes this enlightening book as "a studio edit of Phish in real-time conversation." Along with Fishman, Page McConnell, Mike Gordon, and Trey Anastasio are revealed in their own words, the result of a spate of interviews conducted by Gehr between 1996's New Year's Eve show at Boston's Fleet Center and 1997's year-end Madison Square Garden run. Much like a Phish show, the conversation rambles back and forth, and the complete portrait of the band only emerges subtly and indirectly, although it certainly does emerge. Most rewarding is when they discuss the process of performing and creating music. They describe "onstage love affairs" between two of the four, and how certain members basically ignored others for years at a time and then finally "discovered" them after a decade of playing together. Some may be happy to know that even Phish own up to the unevenness (read: boredom) of some of their extended musical journeys.</p><p> In many ways, <i>The Phish Book</i> serves as a gift to die-hard fans, often diving into some of the band's more esoteric mythology: the origins of songs and lyrics, the various recording processes, the Dude of Life, and so on. The treasure-trove of photos includes shots of bars and stadiums, onstage and backstage, giant flying hot dogs, fans clothed and not, Fishman clothed and not. But the uninitiated can gain much-needed perspective from this enjoyable book as well. They'll learn how Phish find a connection between all styles of music, and use this connection (implied or otherwise) to inform their own music. And they might be surprised to discover how much substance there is behind the twirling fans and endless jams. <i>--Marc Greilsamer</i></p>Richard Gehr is an Oregon writer who lives in Brooklyn.

Narrowly escaping a British trap during the Battle of Brooklyn, Washington didn't credit his survival to courage or tactical expertise; he blamed himself for marching his men into certain doom and marveled at the Providence that delivered them. Throughout his career, Washington held fast to the conviction that America's liberty was dependent on our faithfulness to God's will and our trust in Providence. <i>Washington's God</i> , shows Washington not only as a man of resource, strength, and virtue, but also as a man with deeply held religious values. This new presentation of Washington-as a man whose religion guided his governance-will bring him into today's debates about the role of faith in government and will challenge everything we thought we knew about the inner life of the father of our country.</p><p><b>Michael Novak</b>, a former U.S. ambassador, has served under Democratic and Republican administrations. He is the author of <i>Belief and Unbelief</i> , <i>The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism</i> , and many other books. His essays and reviews have been published in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> , <i>National Review</i> , and many others. He presently holds the George Frederick Jewett Chair in Religion, Philosophy, and Public Policy at the American Enterprise Institute. Mr. Novak lives with his family in Washington, D.C. <b>Jana Novak</b> is a writer and poet and is the co-author of <i>Tell Me Why: A Father Answers His Daughter's Questions About God</i> . She lives in Washington, D.C.Most modern historians have made three basic assumptions about the religious views of our nation's first president: he was a deist; he was only a marginal Christian who kept up appearances but had no depth of conviction; and he believed only in an impersonal force or destiny that he called "Providence." Michael Novak, the well-known conservative thinker and author of <i>The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism</i>, teams up with his daughter Jana to attempt to debunk all three of these notions about Washington's religious views. Written at the specific request of Mount Vernon and with the assistance of their archives, this book is carefully researched. It is most persuasive when the Novaks show that despite his natural reserve, a depth of religious feeling ran through Washington's public and private speeches and correspondence, disproving the portrait of a tepid, perfunctory Anglicanism. However, they don't succeed as well in disproving Washington's deist sensibility; the Novaks adopt the modern assumption that being a Christian and being a deist were mutually exclusive&#x2014;a conclusion that few in the late 18th century would have shared. At times, the Novaks' starry-eyed admiration of the man pushes this book over the bounds of biography into hagiography. <i>(Mar. 6)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

BINGHAM PRIZE FOR DEBUT SHORT STORY COLLECTION<br></b><br> The eleven stories in Will Mackin&#x2019;s mesmerizing debut collection draw from his many deployments with a special operations task force in Iraq and Afghanistan. They began as notes he jotted on the inside of his forearm in grease pencil and, later, as bullet points on the torn-off flap of an MRE kit. Whenever possible he incorporated those notes into his journals. Years later, he used those journals to write this book.<br><br> Together, the stories in&nbsp;<i>Bring Out the Dog </i>offer a remarkable portrait of the absurdity and poetry that define life in the most elite, clandestine circles of modern warfare. It is a world of intense bonds, ancient credos, and surprising compassion&#x2014;of success, failure, and their elusive definitions. Moving between settings at home and abroad, in vivid language that reflects the wonder and discontent of war, Mackin draws the reader into a series of surreal, unsettling, and deeply human episodes:&nbsp;In &#x201c;Crossing the River No Name,&#x201d; a close call suggests that miracles do exist, even if they are in brutally short supply; in &#x201c;Great Circle Route Westward Through Perpetual Night,&#x201d; the death of the team&#x2019;s beloved dog plunges them into a different kind of grief; in &#x201c;Kattekoppen,&#x201d; a man struggles to reconcile his commitments as a father and his commitments as a soldier; and in &#x201c;Baker&#x2019;s Strong Point,&#x201d; a man whose job it is to pull things together struggles with a loss of control.<br><br> Told without a trace of false bravado and with a keen, Barry Hannah&#x2013;like sense of the absurd, <i>Bring Out the Dog</i> manages to capture the tragedy and heroism, the degradation and exultation, in the smallest details of war.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Bring Out the Dog</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Cuts through all the shiny and hyped-up rhetoric of wartime, and aggressively and masterfully draws a picture of the brutal, frightening, and even boring moments of deployment. . . .&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Things They Carried,</i>&nbsp;<i>Redeployment,</i>&nbsp;and now&nbsp;<i>Bring Out the Dog:</i>&nbsp;war stories for your bookshelf that will last a very long time, and serve as reminders of what America was, is, and can still become.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Chicago Review of Books</i></b></p><p>WILL MACKIN, a veteran of the U.S. Navy, served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

It was February, during which the weather was dog shit, so a degree of slowness was expected. But this went beyond slowness. It was like peace had broken out and nobody&#x2019;d told us. Nights we&#x2019;d meet in the OPS hut for the mission brief. We&#x2019;d tune the flatscreens to the drones&#x2014;over Ghazni, Orgun, and Khost&#x2014;only to find all three orbiting within the same cloud. We&#x2019;d listen to static on the UHF. We&#x2019;d stare at phones that never rang. We might&#x2019;ve left it all behind, walked off the outpost and into the desert, never to be seen again. We might&#x2019;ve created the Legend of the Lost Troop. Rather, we chose someplace where we imagined the enemy might be hiding&#x2014;a compound on the banks of the Helmand River, a brake shop in downtown Marjah, a cave high in the Hindu Kush&#x2014;and we ventured out there, hoping for a fight.<br><br>I thought of the Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima, who, in March 1945, when their island fell to the Americans, may not have known that their island had fallen. Who, a few months later, may not have heard that A-bombs had destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that their emperor had admitted defeat. Those soldiers hid in tunnels on Iwo for weeks after the war was over. For months, even. For them, the fight continued in those dark and narrow spaces, until they ran out of food. Until they drank the last of their water. Until, absent the means and/or the will to take their own lives, they climbed out of rat holes into the sun, to wander warm fields of lava rock, in surrender.<br><br>I wondered what it would take for us. If, one night, we&#x2019;d drop out of the starry sky in our blacked-out helicopters near a walled compound in the desert. We&#x2019;d run toward that compound with the rotor wash at our backs, pushing us into the dust cloud that had been kicked up by our arrival, and out the other side. Passing through a crooked archway in the compound&#x2019;s outer wall, we&#x2019;d enter the courtyard. And there, among the fig trees and goats, we&#x2019;d find an American tourist with a camera strapped around his neck.<br><br>Having served his time in Afghanistan, our fellow American had gone home, fallen in love, gotten married, and had the two bow-headed daughters now hiding behind his legs. Maybe he&#x2019;d wanted his girls to see how brightly the stars shone in the desert. Maybe he&#x2019;d wanted to share with them all the strange places the army had sent him, way back when. I imagined that he&#x2019;d look at us with understanding and remorse.<br><br>&#x201c;Dudes, war&#x2019;s over.&#x201d;<br><br>But, as far as we knew, it wasn&#x2019;t. Therefore, we&#x2019;d meet in the OPS hut every night at eight. In the absence of new intelligence, we&#x2019;d review old intelligence. We&#x2019;d double-check dead ends and reexamine cold cases. Finding nothing mission-worthy, Hal, our troop chief, would open the floor to suggestions. It&#x2019;d be quiet for a while, as everyone thought.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Hal would say.<br><br>He&#x2019;d be standing in the middle of the plywood room. We&#x2019;d be sitting on plywood tables, balancing on busted swivel chairs, leaning against the thin walls. Drones, orbiting inside moonlit thunderheads, would beam their emerald visions back to us. Lightning would strike twenty miles away and the UHF would crackle. I, for one, didn&#x2019;t have any good ideas to offer.<br><br>One night, Digger spoke up. &#x201c;Who remembers that graveyard decorated like a used-car lot, out in Khost?&#x201d;<br><br>I raised my hand, along with a few others.<br><br>&#x201c;I think we need to go back there,&#x201d; Digger said.<br><br>The graveyard in question was on the northern rim of a dusty crater. We&#x2019;d patrolled past it, a few weeks prior, on an easterly course. The &#x201c;used-car lot&#x201d; decorations were plastic strands of multicolored pennants. One end of each strand was tied high in an ash tree that stood at the center of the graveyard. The other ends were staked into the hard ground outside the circle of graves. The graves themselves were piles of stones, shaped like overturned rowboats. I couldn&#x2019;t recall the name of our mission that night, its task and purpose, its outcome. But that graveyard stuck with me. I remembered the pennants snapping in the wind, dust parting around the graves like current.<br><br>Digger, who&#x2019;d passed closer to the graveyard than I, thought the graves had looked suspicious. He believed they resembled old cellar doors. The type, I imagined, you&#x2019;d find outside a farmhouse in Nebraska. The type you&#x2019;d run to from darkened fields as a tornado was bearing down. Digger postulated that at least one of those graves was made of fake stones.<br><br>&#x201c;Styrofoam balls,&#x201d; he suggested to us in the OPS hut, &#x201c;painted to look like stones, then glued to a plywood sheet.&#x201d; Digger wondered if we might sneak into that graveyard, pull open this hypothetical door, descend a flight of stairs, and discover a Taliban nerve center, bomb factory, or armory. Digger had no idea what might be down there, but he&#x2019;d gotten a weird feeling walking past that graveyard that night.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s make it happen,&#x201d; Hal said.<br><br>We rode our helicopters&#x2014;two dual-rotor, minigun-equipped MH-47s&#x2014;southeast from Logar. We sat in mesh jump seats, across from one another, roughly ten per side. The MH-47, at altitude, stabilized like a swaying hammock. Its engines warbled like cop cars racing off to faraway trouble. Lube, dripping from the crankcase, smelled like bong water. At the back end of the tubular cargo bay, beyond the open ramp, night passed by like scenery in an old movie.<br><br>The 47s dropped us off in a dry riverbed, three miles west of the graveyard. We patrolled eastward under heavy clouds. The clouds carried a powerful static charge, while the earth remained neutral. Sparkling dust hovered, and my brothers, walking with me, appeared as concentrations of this dust. All I heard, as we walked, was my own breathing.<br><br>We connected with the crater&#x2019;s westernmost point, then walked in a clockwise direction along its rim until we reached the graveyard. We found the pennants torn and tattered; the ash tree diseased; the graves crooked. None of the stones were made of Styrofoam. Not one of the graves was an elaborately disguised entrance to a nefarious subterranean activity. Though, upon closer inspection, I noticed that the dust that I&#x2019;d remembered parting around the graves, resembling current, actually funneled into the spaces between stones. In fact, the dust appeared to be getting sucked into those spaces. Which made it seem like there was some sort of void below the graves, creating a vacuum, and lent a measure of credence to Digger&#x2019;s theory.<br><br>From the top of one grave, I selected a smooth, round stone, about the size of a shot-put ball, and I heaved it into the crater.<br><br>Joe, our interpreter, was right there to scold me. &#x201c;I would expect such disrespectful behavior from the Taliban,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but not from you.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe was Afghani. His real name was Jamaluddein. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in 1980, he&#x2019;d escaped to the U.K. with his parents. Joe was twelve years old at the time. Now, as a middle-aged man, he&#x2019;d returned to help save his country from ruin. He wore armor on missions, but he carried no weapons. His interpretations of our enemy&#x2019;s muttered words were always clear and precise. He had a bad habit of walking too close behind me on patrol, then closing that distance whenever we made contact with the enemy. Sometimes he&#x2019;d bump into me and I&#x2019;d turn around. Thus, I&#x2019;d seen conflagrations reflected in the smudged lenses of Joe&#x2019;s glasses. I&#x2019;d heard him whisper prayers between sporadic detonations. His voice, with its derived British accent and perpetual tone of disappointment, exactly matched that of my beleaguered conscience.<br><br>So I jumped into the crater after the stone. I found it at the end of a long, concave groove in the dust. Turning back toward the crater&#x2019;s rim, I saw my bootprints descending the slope, as perfect as footsteps on the moon. On my way back up to the graveyard, I was careful not to disturb those tracks, or the flawless groove that had been carved by the stone. I wanted these things preserved, I supposed, in the event that an asteroid should slam into the planet, sloughing away the atmosphere, boiling the seas, and ending life on earth in a matter of seconds.<br><br>Our troop&#x2014;asphyxiated, desiccated, frozen&#x2014;would lie scattered about the graveyard, perfectly preserved in the seamless void of space forever, or at least until other intelligent beings came along and discovered us. Perhaps because these beings existed as thin bars of blue light, incapable of offensive or defensive action, they&#x2019;d puzzle over our armor, rifles, night-vision devices, and grenades. They&#x2019;d wonder, especially, why we&#x2019;d worn such things to a graveyard. There&#x2019;d be no mystery, however, regarding the bootprints in the crater, since they&#x2019;d know, by the boots still on my feet, that I&#x2019;d been the one who&#x2019;d left them. Furthermore, they&#x2019;d deduce, by the groove, that I&#x2019;d descended into the crater after a stone. Only one stone could&#x2019;ve cut that groove. Thus, they&#x2019;d find it among a thousand others, right where I&#x2019;d returned it, atop the grave, just moments before the asteroid had struck the earth. But none of that would explain how the stone had wound up in the crater in the first place.<br><br>Had one of them thrown it? the curious bars of blue light might ask themselves.<br><br>The next night, in the OPS hut, we still had nothing, intelligence-wise. Hal asked for suggestions again. Another hush fell on the troop as we sat thinking. Hal stood in the middle of the plywood room. On the one hand, he loved the war. On the other, he loved us. Green clouds floated by on the flatscreens. Fuzzy static emanated from the UHF. Archie, who, a month prior, had replaced Yaz, who we&#x2019;d lost in a soybean field in Konduz, stood up from the floor. He pulled a tin of breath mints from his shirt pocket.<br><br>&#x201c;I probably should&#x2019;ve told you guys about this sooner,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The tin, Archie explained, had arrived in the mail about two weeks ago. It was sent by Yaz&#x2019;s widow, whose name was Connie.<br><br>I knew Connie from troop barbecues, Halloween parties, and the like. I remembered her, once, dressed as a cowgirl and dancing in Digger&#x2019;s kitchen. She fired cap guns at the ceiling, which made the fluorescent light hazy. Yaz, standing by the bean dip, watched his wife holster her toy pistols. He smiled as she spun an invisible lasso over her head. Roping Yaz, Connie pulled him in, hand over hand, while Yaz feigned resistance. His breath must&#x2019;ve smelled like corn chips. Hers, I imagined, smelled just fine.<br><br>The tin Archie showed us in the OPS hut contained a handful of Yaz&#x2019;s ashes.<br><br>&#x201c;Connie asked me to find a good place to spread these around,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And I tried, but no place seems good enough. You guys got any ideas?&#x201d;<br><br>Digger suggested that we climb to the top of Mount No-shack&#x2014;i.e., the tallest peak in Afghanistan&#x2014;and release Yaz&#x2019;s ashes into a spindrift. Tull proposed a verdant meadow, north of J-bad, where he and Yaz once went AWOL to hunt elk. I made an argument for the tiny garden of purple flowers that had grown behind Yaz&#x2019;s tent, where he used to spit out his toothpaste. Hal, however, wanted to return to Konduz.<br><br>Konduz was four hundred kilometers north of Logar. The 47s flew higher than usual to get there. Frost formed on the cargo bay&#x2019;s circular windows. The engines whined, the rotors slipped, and the helicopter wobbled as if we were balancing at the end of a very long pole. I almost hoped that something would go wrong. Nothing catastrophic, of course. Just a low-oil light or engine temperature creeping into the red. Something that would force us to land short and reconsider. I didn&#x2019;t want to see that field again, in Konduz, with its dark puddles reflecting the stars, with its soybean shoots glowing white. I didn&#x2019;t want to smell its fertilized tang. But nothing went wrong. We touched down on the western edge of the field, right where we&#x2019;d touched down before, opposite the ditch that had given me so much trouble.<br><br>We&#x2019;d first landed in that field on a clear night in late December. Jupiter had been the focal point of a crescent moon. The ditch where we knew the enemy was hiding was east of our position, and outside of small-arms range. I thought, at the time, that there were no more than a half dozen Taliban in that ditch. I&#x2019;d based that estimate, partly, on how the shrubbery had quaked when they&#x2019;d scurried around behind it. I&#x2019;d considered, as well, the frequency of AK fire, which, from that safe distance, sounded like movie projectors running out of film. I&#x2019;d seen and heard these things before. For six Taliban wallowing in a muddy ditch, I figured that a pair of thousand-pound bombs, with delayed fuses, ought to do the trick.<br><br>A combination of ash and sissoo trees stood in that ditch. Shrubbery tangled the spaces between those trees. I brought two jets in from the north, in trail formation. The first bomb ignited every tree and shrub. The second launched their burning trunks like moon shots. I turned to my right, expecting to find Hal. Instead, I found Joe&#x2014;hands in pockets, armored belly protruding. The burning trench was reflected in his dirty glasses.<br><br>Hal appeared from behind me. &#x201c;You done?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>What remained of the shrubbery was still, and the AKs had fallen silent.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>We spread ourselves the length of the field for mop-up, then walked toward the ditch in a line abreast. Stars jiggled in puddles. The mud reeked of nitrogen. Soybean shoots resembled those albino creatures that lived in the Atlantic&#x2019;s deepest trench. Hal walked next to me. Yaz walked five men past Hal. The machine gun Yaz carried weighed as much as the front axle on a Sentra. Its rounds were the size of soup cans. As we stepped into small-arms range, Tull whistled like a bird, in warning. A Taliban popped out of the ditch seconds later. The barrel of his AK, we believed, was bent. The majority of his volley curved skyward.<br><br>More Taliban leapt from the ditch after Yaz fell. Dozens, in fact. We turned them around quick enough; then we fell back, dragging Yaz. Joe was right behind me, breathing hard. Hal called for CASEVAC even though Yaz was already dead. Maybe he didn&#x2019;t want us thinking that he wouldn&#x2019;t do the same thing for us. Maybe he wanted to give us one more reason to believe that he&#x2019;d never give up. Or maybe he just wanted us to fight and not worry about it.<br><br>I called out to every jet in the sky. The first wave arrived just as the CASEVAC was lifting off with Yaz. I brought the jets down in a clockwise spiral. I had them toss everything they had&#x2014;five-hundred-, one-thousand-, two-thousand-pounders&#x2014;into the ditch. A second wave of jets joined the first in the spiral, then a third, and a fourth. I bombed the ditch until the mud puddles in the soybean field steamed, until the soybean shoots themselves melted, until it seemed as though I were standing in the ditch and bombing the field.<br><br>That soybean field looked no different in February. The ditch was unchanged, too, although some of the trees and shrubbery were gone. I stood in the same place I&#x2019;d stood while controlling the jets, back in December. The rest of the troop walked into the field behind Archie. They formed a circle around him at the spot where Yaz was killed. Archie took a knee and pulled the tin from his pocket. He opened the lid and tapped the side of the tin with his finger. I didn&#x2019;t want to see the ashes fall, so I turned around, and there was Joe.<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t your fault,&#x201d; he said.</p><h2>The Best Women&#39;s Travel Writing, Volume 9: True Stories from Around the World (Best Women&#39;s Travel Writing, 9)</h2><p>Anyone whose passport has been stamped a few times knows the surest method of keeping the travel fire alive: by reading and telling stories from the road, passing them along like a torch in a relay race.<br><br>From Travelers&#x2019; Tales comes <i>The Best Women&#x2019;s Travel Writing, Volume 9: True Stories from Around the World</i> the ninth collection in the annual best-selling, award-winning series that invites readers to ride shotgun alongside intrepid female nomads as they travel the globe to discover new places, people, and facets of themselves.

When the marchers swung past the meeting hall of the Industrial Workers of the World, a group of veterans broke ranks, charged the hall, and were met by gunshots. Before the day was over, four of the marchers were dead and one of the Wobblies had been lynched by the mob.<br><br>Through a wealth of newly available primary source material including previously sealed court documents, FBI records released under the Freedom of Information Act, and interviews with surviving witnesses, Tom Copeland has pieced together the events of that day and has traced the fate of the men who were accused and convicted of murdering the marchers. Copeland focuses on Elmer Smith, the local attorney who advised the Wobblies that they had the right to defend their hall against an anticipated attack.<br><br>Although he never belonged to the IWW, Smith sympathized with their interests, championing the rights of working people, and speaking on their behalf. He was originally arrested with the Wobbles and then took up their cause in the courts, beginning a life-long struggle to free the men who were charged with murdering the Centralia marchers. Copeland recounts Smith&#x2019;s disbarment and eventual reinstatement, his run for political office, his speeches throughout the Northwest, and his unyielding support for the workers&#x2019; cause.<br><br>This book is a balanced treatment of the Centalia tragedy and its legal repercussions written by a practicing lawyer. It is also a compelling human drama, centering on the marginal life of an industrial frontier labor lawyer, a study of radical politics of the 1920s, and a depiction of conditions of life in the lumber camps and towns. It is thus biography as well as legal, political, and social history.</p><p>The book is a balanced treatment of the Centralia tragedy and its legal repercussions.

Coe (anthropology emeritus, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale U.) and Kerr, whose rollout camera revolutionized the study of Mayan pictorial ceramics and their texts, explore the script's origins, character, and writing techniques as well as the exalted world of the Maya artist-scribes who kept the holy books. Escribanos continued the role, though not the hieroglyphics, in post-conquest Mexico. Includes 117 color plates, other text figures, and notes on a type of Maya Rosetta Stone. 9.75x13&lt;"&gt;. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>Gorgeously illustrated and relating a fascinating linguistic tale, this look at the art of classic Maya scribes by anthropologist Coe and photographer Kerr includes the latest research into the deciphering of this mysterious writing. Maya scribes were both men and women, the authors write, and were much appreciated in a world where literature, art and mathematics had achieved unusual heights. The Classic Maya period lasted from about A.D. 250 until about A.D. 900, and its cities included Palenque in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala and Copan in Honduras. Although the Olmecs in Mexico were the first in the hemisphere to have writing, the Maya, according to the authors, were "the only pre-conquest people in the New World to have a writing system sophisticated enough to express anything that was in their language." Maya writing, carved on stones such as jade, traced on pottery or painted on walls, deals almost exclusively with historical events--notably the constant wars waged between the city-states. Mythical characters appear, but mostly as part of paintings that represent actual historical figures, their places in the rich dreamworld of the Maya as well as where they rank in the pecking order of their cities indicated by fantastic headdresses. The authors mostly manage to keep the discussion accessible to the lay reader, but occasionally they do veer off into territory where only linguists would feel at home. Generally, the explanations are clear and compelling and the concrete examples of how Maya language developed and was rendered into art by scribes will shed light not only on language but on history and culture. <p></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Beloved Invader</h2><p>Beloved Christian author Eugenia Price continues her chronicle of the history and romance of St. Simons Island, Georgia, in this final novel in her classic St. Simons Trilogy.</p><p></p><h2>Never A Dry Moment (Baby Blues Scrapbook, Book 17)</h2><p>"Family-friendly comic strips would seem to be nonexistent these days.

But from within their strongly defined unity of ideals, an astonishingly varied body of poetry emerged. Robin Skelton has arranged the poetry to make an illuminating &#x2018;critical essay&#x2019; of the period, and in his introduction he brilliantly probes the moods and mores of an intensely troubled and creative decade.</p><p><b>Robin Skelton</b>&nbsp;(12 October 1925 &#x2013; 22 August 1997) was a British-born academic, writer, poet, and&nbsp;anthologist.</p><h2>The World of Odysseus</h2><p>&#34;If it is true that European history began with the Greeks, it is equally true that Greek history began with the world of Odysseus.

Finley, author.</p><p><b>M. I. Finley</b> (1912-1986), the son of Nathan Finkelstein and Anna Katzellenbogen, was born in New York City. He graduated from Syracuse University at the age of fifteen and received an MA in public law from Columbia, before turning to the study of ancient history. During the thirties, Finley taught at Columbia and City College and developed an interest in the sociology of the ancient world that was shaped in part by his association with members of the Frankfurt School who were working in exile in America. In 1952, when he was teaching at Rutgers, Finley was summoned before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and asked whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party. He refused to answer, invoking the Fifth Amendment; by the end of the year he had been fired from the university by a unanimous vote of its trustees. Unable to find work in the US, Finley moved to England, where he taught for many years at Cambridge, helping to redirect the focus of classical education from a narrow emphasis on philology to a wider concern with culture, economics, and society. He became a British subject in 1962 and was knighted in 1979.

Between a racially fueled diplomatic dispute, the appearance of a hermaphroditic old flame, and a bizarre Cetagandan genetic conspiracy, Miles just can't seem to get a minute of peace with his new wife, the lovely and resourceful Ekaterin (whom Miles courted in <i>A Civil Campaign</i>). <p> Miles had hoped to give "hands-on op games" a rest once and for all, but when the Emperor urgently calls on him to resolve a "legal entanglement" in Quaddiespace, diplomacy alone might prove inadequate. (Quaddies, you'll remember, are the no-legged, four-armed free-fallers introduced in <i>Falling Free</i>.) Our newly minted Imperial Auditor almost immediately forgets all about "Baby's First Cell Division" (after the assignment comes in, Ekaterin quickly observes "You know, you keep claiming your job is boring, Miles, but your eyes have gone all bright"), but even Miles feels the heat after his diplomatic attempts devolve into a series of flattering assassination attempts. </p><p> Vorkosigan (and family now!) is as winning as ever, with Bujold offering up her usual fun mix of space-opera action and droll social commentary in a character-centered plot. And here's a bonus for Milesophiles and Vorkosiga novices alike: a book-by-book timeline detailing what trouble Miles got into and when. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><i>Author's Note</i>:<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A Bujold Reading-Order Guide</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br>&nbsp;<br>My fantasy novels are not hard to order.

I favor internal chronological, with a few adjustments.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Shards of Honor</i> and <i>Barrayar.</i> The first two books in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar. <i>Shards</i> was my very first novel ever; <i>Barrayar</i> was actually my eighth, but continues the tale the next day after the end of <i>Shards</i>.

Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not sharesettings or characters with the main body of the series.

This fascinating work of narrative history tells the little-known story of this exploratory mission and reveals how it set the stage for the climactic Battle of the Little Bighorn two years later.What is the significance of this obscure foray into the Black Hills? The short answer, as the author explains, is that Custer found gold. This discovery in the context of the worst economic depression the country had yet experienced spurred a gold rush that brought hordes of white prospectors to the Sioux&#39;s sacred grounds. The result was the trampling of an 1868 treaty that had granted the Black Hills to the Sioux and their inevitable retaliation against the white invasion.The author brings the era of the Grant administration to life, with its &#34;peace policy&#34; of settling the Indians on reservations, corrupt federal Indian Bureau, Gilded Age excesses, the building of the western railroads, the white settlements that followed the tracks, the Crash of 1873, mining ventures, and the clash of white and Indian cultures with diametrically opposed values.The discovery of gold in the Black Hills was the beginning of the end of Sioux territorial independence. By the end of the book it is clear why the Sioux leader Fast Bear called the trail cut by Custer to the Black Hills &#34;thieves&#39; road.&#34;</p><p><b>Terry Mort</b> is the author of <i>The Wrath of Cochise</i> (Pegasus, 2013), <i>The Hemingway Patrols</i> (Scribner, 2009), a book on fly fishing, and edited anthologies of Mark Twain, Jack London, and Zane Grey (Lyons Press). <i>The Wrath of Cochise</i> was widely praised and received excellent reviews in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>Publishers Weekly</i>. <i>The Hemingway Patrols</i>, also widely praised, was Amazon's best book of the month in August 2009.From the Introduction<br><br>In the summer of 1874, Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer led some one thousand men&#x2014;cavalry, infantry, civilian teamsters, and scientists&#x2014;on an exploration of the Black Hills of South Dakota. The expedition consisted of ten companies of cavalry, two companies of infantry, an artillery detachment to service three Gatling guns and a three-inch-caliber rifled artillery piece. Officers included Custer&#x2019;s brother Tom, as well as a number of others whose names would appear on the &#x201c;killed in action&#x201d; list two years later at the Little Bighorn. Youngest brother, Boston, went as a civilian guide even though he knew nothing of the country and spent most of his time wandering away and getting lost. He, too, would be killed at the Little Bighorn. Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Fred Grant, son of the president, went as an &#x201c;acting aide&#x201d; to Custer and an observer for General Philip Sheridan. He had apparently inherited his father&#x2019;s taste for alcohol, if not his ability as a soldier. But he was a good companion, and Custer liked him. Custer also surely understood that a solid relationship with Fred made very good political sense. ...&nbsp;<br><br>The expedition left from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, a rough-hewn town on the upper Missouri River, and the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad. They would be gone two months: July and August. The troops and their civilians would travel some three hundred miles southwest across the Plains and Badlands before reaching the Black Hills, which by the time they arrived seemed like an oasis, as indeed they were, of a kind. Given the size of Custer&#x2019;s force (larger even than the one he took to the Little Bighorn), he felt he could handle anything that came along. But he knew he was going into potentially hostile territory. (In a letter to Terry he said: &#x201c;I am confident the Indians do not intend to strew flowers on our pathway.&#x201d;) And he knew he might very well be outnumbered if it came to a fight. Trying to understand the odds before he left, Custer communicated with a regional Indian agent who told him the best estimate of Sioux and Northern Cheyenne in the different agencies of the North Platte and Missouri was more than three thousand warriors, most of whom were armed with &#x201c;one or more pistols, exclusive of other arms. All have bows and arrows. About one-half of the warriors remaining at the agencies have repeating rifles, all others breechloaders. I have known Indians at the White River Agency to have as many as 3000 rounds of ammunition for a single gun . . . fully three fourths of all enumerated are hostile.&#x201d;<br><br>Apparently, Custer might need all the men he had and, perhaps, then some.The stated objective of the expedition was to explore the area and find a location for a permanent military installation&#x2014;a fort. The proposed fort was a response to Sioux and Cheyenne attacks on the settlements to the south&#x2014;settlements below the boundary of the Sioux reservation (essentially the southern border of South Dakota). The army needed a post near the Nebraska border to interdict, or discourage, warriors heading from the reservations to the southern settlements and travel routes. As General Sheridan put it: &#x201c;by holding an interior point in the heart of the Indian country we could threaten the villages and stock of the Indians, if they made raids on our settlements.&#x201d;<br><br>Custer had another objective, however, one that was unstated (and even officially disavowed) by the army but well understood by the civilians (and troops)&#x2014;both those on the expedition and those watching and cheering the effort. That was to determine whether there was gold in the Black Hills. For decades there had been rumors and stories about potentially rich gold deposits in the Hills, but no one knew whether those stories were true&#x2014;or, more accurately, whether there was enough gold to justify the risks of looking for it. The remoteness and inaccessibility of the Hills coupled with Sioux enmity had been historical barriers to thorough investigation. But Custer&#x2019;s expedition was probably strong enough to deal with any war parties, and his practical miners were there to determine whether the rumors of gold had some basis in fact.<br><br>Though this objective was kept sub rosa, there is no doubt that Custer was intent on making the discovery, if there was anything to discover. As Lieutenant James Calhoun, Custer&#x2019;s adjutant and brother-in-law wrote: &#x201c;The Commanding Officer of the Expedition has expressed a desire on many occasions to explore the Black Hills, believing that it would open a rich vein of wealth calculated to increase the commercial prosperity of this country. Having this object in view, he made known his impressions through the recognized military channels&#x2014;which were favorably received.&#x201d; The &#x201c;which&#x201d; in this case of course refers to Custer&#x2019;s recommendations, not those of the military channels. So it&#x2019;s fair to wonder whether the idea for the expedition originated with Custer or Sheridan. Given their close personal relationship it&#x2019;s likely that they were of the same mind about the expedition&#x2019;s goals, stated and otherwise. Two birds with one stone.<br><br>There was some difficulty about the whole project, though&#x2014;the Black Hills were part of the Sioux reservation, granted by the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. Under the treaty, no whites other than &#x201c;officers, agents and employees of the government&#x201d; assigned to, or servicing, various agencies were permitted to enter the reservation. In fact, the army was responsible for intercepting or evicting any civilian individuals or outfits that entered the Hills or any part of the reservation. And in the period after the 1868 treaty until Custer&#x2019;s expedition (and even afterward), the army did just that. As General Terry warned in a letter to the <i>Sioux City Times</i>, any enterprise heading for the Black Hills would be illegal and &#x201c;the consummation of which it will be my duty, under the law, and my instructions to prevent by the use, if necessary, of the troops at my disposal.&#x201d; The very idea that US troops would use force to prevent US citizens from exploring useful land, given away to hostile Indians, raised more than a few hackles among western politicians and editorialists&#x2014;to say nothing of regular citizens. Nor did the army have much sympathy for this assignment. But they did it. Note that the army prevented white settlers from going into the Black Hills even before the treaty. In 1867 General William T. Sherman wrote to Terry: &#x201c;I agree with you perfectly that we are not in a position to permit an invasion of that region, for no sooner would a settlement be inaugurated than an appeal would come for protection. . . . You may therefore forbid all white people going there at present and warn all who go in spite of your prohibition, that the United States will not protect them now, or until public notice is given that the Indian title is extinguished.&#x201d; Sherman was simultaneously worried that the &#x201c;invasion&#x201d; would stir up the Sioux and that his limited resources would be stretched by a called-for additional post. Note, too, that Sherman refers to the Indians&#x2019; &#x201c;title&#x201d; to the land, and this was before the treaty legalized that title. ...<br><br>National and international economics and politics were some of the driving forces behind Custer&#x2019;s expedition&#x2014;to the extent that looking for gold was an unspoken objective. The United States and most of Europe were in the grips of a terrible economic depression. The economies of these countries had recently become intertwined through a combination of trade and international finance. (Odd as it may seem, it is possible to trace the connections between the 1873 collapse of the Russian wheat market and Custer&#x2019;s mission&#x2014;as will be described later.) If Custer could find gold in the Black Hills, there would be a significant and positive ripple effect throughout the sagging US economy. But as importantly, the US Treasury was still trying to dig out from under the mountain of debt incurred during the Civil War&#x2014;debt that was denominated in gold and would therefore have to be repaid in gold. In short, gold mattered to more than just the rough-and-ready prospectors who found it. They would sell it, one way or another, through the banking system, and the gold would be bought by the Treasury, monetized, and then used to pay federal debts. The availability&#x2014;and possibility&#x2014;of gold therefore affected national political and economic decisions. Consequently, the Black Hills Expedition was more important than just a reconnaissance in force, and there was more to be looked for than just a site for a fort. There were also reports that the Hills contained other valuable resources, beyond the gold. The land was said to be ideal for agriculture, ranching, and timbering. It was well watered and wooded, with broad meadows for grazing or farming. Game animals were plentiful. As a result of these circulating stories, the Hills were a source of continuing and violent frustration among white westerners, who were enduring the difficulties of the depression, like their cousins in the east. Plains farmers whose crops were devastated by hordes of grasshoppers thought longingly of the reported fertility of the Hills. Town builders on the treeless Plains thought with equal longing of the vast timber resources. That such a magnificent combination of natural resources should lie undeveloped and unused, except by the occasional Sioux hunting party, outraged the western settlers. ...<br><br>In short, the western press and population hated the treaty and warmly endorsed Custer&#x2019;s expedition. They saw it for what it was&#x2014;the thin edge of the wedge.<br><br>To say that looking for gold (and other resources) was an unpublicized objective is not to suggest that the stated military objective was a fiction to cover a gold-hunting expedition. On the contrary, the military and economic objectives were, in this case, perfectly congruent. That congruency was typical of this period in which the federal government and private enterprise cooperated closely on a number of projects deemed to be in the national interest. If people managed to get rich in the process, so much the better. Further, the army&#x2019;s role in settling the west went well beyond battles with native tribes. It involved mapping and collecting scientific information about the largely unknown territories. Officers who had been trained at West Point&#x2014;especially those who did well academically&#x2014;were primarily engineers, surveyors, and scientists, since that was the primary focus of the Academy&#x2019;s curriculum. The best performers were well prepared for scientific and topographical missions. Militarily, the story was slightly different. Officers were trained in the traditional Napoleonic tactics: artillery preparation followed by a massed bayonet charge with cavalry waiting to exploit defensive gaps or lapses, or to block enemy maneuvers. The carnage of the Civil War was to a very real extent the result of the Academy&#x2019;s tactical curriculum, which was hardly different from those of the European academies. The Academy prepared the professionals for war between nation-states, and although the tactics were wasteful and suicidal, the officers at least could tell themselves they were following the rules. Unfortunately, the Academy graduates were totally unprepared for the task of finding and fighting Indians. That subject was considered a waste of time at the Point. As a result, there were no rules to follow.<br><br>But the key point is that Custer&#x2019;s expedition was by no means unique or unusual in combining military and scientific/geographic objectives. The army did not see them as separate missions. If you were going to fight over a ground, you needed to know what it looked like. And if your country had acquired vast new territory&#x2014;even if it was uninhabited and uncontested&#x2014;it was your job to map it and discover any indications of natural resources. As an example, the five initial surveys of potential transcontinental roads (initially stagecoach and ultimately railroad) were conducted before the Civil War by junior officers of the army. And well conducted, too. Finally, most of the West was federal territory. Who but the army was available to survey and evaluate it? Until Custer&#x2019;s expedition, the Black Hills were mostly terra incognita, as far as white settlers and the army were concerned. The Hills are a mysterious island rising from the Plains. They appear from the Plains to be a citadel with no access points. And it is a mighty citadel, at that; they cover more than forty-five hundred square miles and sit along the border between southwestern South Dakota and Wyoming....<br><br>The Sioux had a particular regard for the Hills as a hunting ground and, for some, as a sacred place. Indeed, Francis Parkman called the Hills &#x201c;a hunter&#x2019;s paradise.&#x201d; When the buffalo in their mysterious ways made themselves scarce, the Sioux could retire to the Black Hills where elk, deer, and antelope were plentiful. Indeed, the Sioux called the Hills their &#x201c;meat pack.&#x201d; (In fact, the Sioux preferred deer to buffalo for flavor and for the softness of its skin, but of course the buffalo herds were vast and provided almost everything the Sioux required&#x2014;food, clothing, utensils, lodge coverings, sinews for rope, even glue.)<br><br>As far as the Sioux were concerned, the Black Hills belonged to them, originally&#x2014;and most legitimately to the Sioux&#x2014;by right of conquest, and more recently under the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, in which the whites granted to the Sioux something, in their eyes, they already owned. If the white man wanted to put something on a sheet of paper, well, that was no substitute for grim and obvious reality, for the unwritten laws of war. But if the treaty meant a cessation in the troubles, then fair enough. And if it could keep greedy miners and frontiersmen out of the Hills, so much the better. Like other native tribes anywhere, the Sioux dreaded the discovery of precious metals in their territory. They knew a gold strike would release a torrent of white miners. And what had been a pristine wilderness, rich in game animals, would be degraded by miners grubbing around in the placers and sluice boxes and returning at night to wretched muddy mining camps offering gambling, whiskey, and loose women. To the Sioux this would be a tragedy of multiple dimensions&#x2014;economic, aesthetic, environmental, and spiritual. It was unthinkable. Black Moon, a Hunkpapa Sioux, reportedly said that any Indian who showed the gold fields to white men should die.<br><br>But the rumors would not die. Lt. Calhoun wrote: &#x201c;I have read in a newspaper of an Indian squaw going into one of our forts some years ago (I believe it was Fort Laramie) and offering to barter or sell a lump of gold about the size of an egg, which she said was obtained from the Black Hills.&#x201d;<br><br>Without the help of any Sioux informers, however, Custer&#x2019;s expedition did find gold. There were no egg-sized nuggets, and it was not a bonanza. But it was enough. It was the news the westerners wanted to hear. It was the political and economic leverage they needed. And from the moment of Custer&#x2019;s first reports of the discovery, Sioux ownership of the Black Hills was doomed, just as they feared it would be&#x2014;but not before a fight, for Custer&#x2019;s expedition was also a significant cause of stirring up, or reigniting, the hostilities of all the Sioux tribes, hostility that resulted in the battle at the Little Bighorn two years later. It was said that George Custer dug his grave&#x2014;and, as importantly, the graves of 262 men&#x2014;when he led an expedition into the Black Hills of South Dakota in the summer of 1874.<br><br>Is that true?

Now, in The Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, the first volume of a magisterial two-volume biography, we at last get Napoleon the man. Robert Asprey tells this fascinating, tragic tale in lush narrative detail. He invites the reader to look over Napoleon&#39;s shoulder as he dictates decrees and orders; deals with his ungrateful, greedy, unprincipled family; comes into conflict with the royalty of Europe; mingles with the intellectuals, writers, musicians, and actors of the day; leads and inspires his officers and men; and falls in love and fathers children with Josephine, Marie Louise, and various mistresses. The Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte becomes an exciting, reckless thrill ride as Asprey charts Napoleon&#39;s vertiginous ascent to fame and the height of power. Here is Napoleon as he was-not saint, not sinner, but a man dedicated to and ultimately devoured by his vision of himself, his empire, and his world.</p><p>Robert Asprey is a former U.S. Marine captain and an esteemed military historian. He is the author of numerous books, including At Bellau Wood, Frederick the Great, and The German High Command at War. He lives in Cadiz, Spain.Asprey, a former marine officer and military historian (Frederick the Great), has produced the first volume of a new two-volume biography of a man who was not only one of the greatest generals in history, but also instrumental in the formation of modern Europe. Covering the period from Napoleon's birth in 1769 to his brilliant victory at Austerlitz in 1805, Asprey charts his subject's rise through military school and his path through the treacherous byways of the French Revolution. Though there is a tendency in the earlier portions of this book to reduce the Revolution to a reign of terror, making it difficult to explain why Napoleon would have been such a fervent follower of the radical Jacobins, Asprey generally provides clear explanations of the political environment in which Napoleon acted. The story of the campaign in Italy that brought the young general his first fame is well told in its military, political and diplomatic aspects, and Asprey's fascinating account of the campaign in Egypt is particularly valuable. Here the author corrects misconceptions of Napoleon's actions, such as the notorious "abandonment" of the French army in Egypt. The military aspects of the story tend to overwhelm the narrative in the final chapters, and a summary chapter would have been helpful. But the chapters are bite-sized, and the text is easy, so this book should find a wide readership among those who enjoy biography, history and military history. Illus.

Apparently he has hordes of students soaking in his condensed wisdom, but in audiobook form it comes across as scattershot and arbitrary. While listeners may be able to implement some of the centering meditative techniques, the lack of a working structure makes this anything but a calming listen. The hyperbolic title is presumably a publisher's attempt to sell more audiobooks.

Young Afsan is privileged, called to the distant Capital City to apprentice with Saleed the court astrologer. But when the time comes for Afsan to make his coming-of-age pilgrimage, to gaze upon the Face of God, his world is changed forever- for what he sees will test his faith... and may save his world from disaster!<br></p><p><br>Robert J.

He was born in Ottawa and lives in Toronto.<br><br><br>Chapter 1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Afsan often escaped to this place. He remembered the first time he had run up this hillside, half a kiloday ago, after his original encounter with the formidable Tak-Saleed.<br>Formidable? Afsan clicked his teeth in humor, figuring that the choice of adjective was a sign that he must be getting accustomed to all this. Back then, after his introduction to the master astrologer, the word he'd used was "monstrous."<br>That first time he'd run up here his only thought had been to get out of the city, get back to his distant home Pack of Carno, back to the simple life of a country boy. He was sure he'd never get used to this dizzying, terrifying world of apprenticeship, of scowling imperial guards, of hundreds of people--ten or more gathered together in the same place at once! Afsan hadn't experienced crowds like that before, never felt such a wash of pheromones over him. He couldn't stand the tension, the constant fear that he was encroaching on another's territory or otherwise breaching protocol. He had found himself tipping from the waist so often it made his head spin.<br>But on that day, as on this, Afsan had been calmed by the magnificent view from here, tension slipping from his body, claws retracting so far that Afsan thought he'd never see them again, tail swishing back and forth in leisurely, contented movements.<br>The sun had set a short time ago. It had swollen to a bloated egg, changing from its normal white to a deep violet, before dropping behind the ragged cones of the Ch'mar volcanoes to the west of the city. A beautiful sunset, Afsan had thought, the wispy clouds a veil across the dimming disk, tinged with purple, with red, with deepest blue. But then Afsan found all sunsets beautiful, and not just because of the play of color across the clouds, although this evening that was indeed spectacular. No, Afsan welcomed sunsets because he preferred the night, craved the stars.<br>This will be a grand night for observing, he thought. The only clouds were around the volcanoes, and those rarely lifted. Overhead, the vast dome of the sky was immaculate.<br>Tonight was odd-night. Most adults slept on odd-nights. For that very reason, Afsan did not. He preferred the peace and tranquillity of the hillsides on those nights when--the thought came unbidden--it was as if they were his own territory.<br>Of course, Afsan owned nothing of value, and, having entered a life of quiet study, his chances of acquiring land were--how did the old joke go?--about as likely as one of the Empress's eggs being used as a game ball.<br>But even if he couldn't own land, he would always have the stars. The sky was darkening quickly, as it always did, and there would only be a short time of real night before even-day broke.<br>Afsan inhaled deeply. The air was as clear as the waters of spring-fed Lake Doognar back home, the smells of--he flexed his nostrils, wrinkled his muzzle--of wildflowers; the scent of a large animal, perhaps an armorback (although how one of those would get this high up a mountain he didn't know); urine on those rocks, likely from a much smaller critter; and, underneath it all, faint, but more prominent than when he'd first arrived in Capital City, the sulfurous tinge of volcanic gases.<br>He had been straddling a boulder, his tail hanging over it, to watch the sun go down. Now it was time to climb higher up the hillside. He did so, the three broad toes on each foot giving him excellent traction. Upon reaching the crest, he clicked his teeth in satisfaction, then continued partway down the other side, placing the bulk of the hill between himself and the torch-lit glow of Capital City. Afsan lowered himself to the ground, and lay on his side to look up at the panorama of the night sky.<br>As usual, Afsan found it uncomfortable with all his weight on his right shoulder and hip, but what alternative was there? Once he had tried lying on his belly in the sleeping position and had craned his neck to look up instead of forward, but that had given him a stinging crick.<br>Dekadays ago, he'd asked Tak-Saleed why there was no easy posture for Quintaglios to look at the stars, why their muscular tails made it impossible to lie on their backs. Saleed had stared down at young Afsan and declared that God had wished it that way, that She had made the stars for Her face alone to gaze upon, not for the pinched muzzles of overly curious apprentices.<br>Afsan slapped his tail sideways against the soil, irritated by the memory. He drew his nictitating membranes over his eyes. The purple glow of the twilight still filtered through, but that was all. Afsan cleared his mind of all thoughts of old Saleed, opened the membranes, and drank in the beauty he had come here to enjoy.<br>The stars scurried from upriver to downriver as the brief night raced by. Two of the moons were prominent at the start of the evening: Slowpoke and the Big One. The Big One was showing only a crescent sliver of illumination, although the rest of its disk could be seen as a round blackness, obscuring the stars. Afsan held his arm out and found that if he unsheathed his thumbclaw, its sickle silhouette appeared about the same height and shape as the Big One. The Big One's orange face was always intriguing--there were markings on it, details just a little too small, just a little too dim, to be clearly made out. What it was, Afsan couldn't say. It seemed <i>rocky</i>, but how could a rock fly through the sky?<br>He turned his attention to Slowpoke. It had been in one of its recalcitrant moods again these past few nights, fighting its way upriver instead of sailing downriver. Oh, the other moons would do that occasionally, too, but never with the determination of tiny Slowpoke. Slowpoke was Afsan's favorite.<br>Someday he would make a study of the moons. He'd read much of what had been written about them, including Saleed's three-volume <i>Dancing the Night Away</i>. Such a whimsical title! How unlike the Saleed he knew, the Saleed he feared.<br>Some of the moons moved quickly across the sky, others took several tens of nights to cross from horizon to horizon. All went through phases, waxing and waning between the extremes of showing a fully lit circular shape and appearing as simply a black circle covering the stars. What did it all mean? Afsan exhaled noisily.<br>He scanned the sky along the ecliptic, that path along which the sun traveled each day. Two planets were visible, bright Kevpel and ruddy Davpel. Planets were similar to the moons, in that they moved against the background stars, but they appeared as tiny pinpoints, revealing no face or details, and their progress against the firmament had to be measured over days or dekadays. A few of the six known planets also showed the strange retrograde motions that some of the moons exhibited, although it took kilodays for them to complete these maneuvers.<br>Near the zenith now was the constellation of the Prophet. Afsan had seen old hand-copied books that called this constellation the Hunter, after Lubal, largest of the Five Original Hunters, but as worship of them was now all but banned, the official name had been changed to honor Larsk, the first to gaze upon the Face of God.<br>Lubal or Larsk, the picture was the same: Points of light marked the shoulders, hips, elbows, knees, and the tip of the long tail. Two bright stars represented the eyes. It was like a reverse image, Afsan thought--the kind one gets after staring at an object, then looking at a white surface--since the prophet's eyes and Lubal's, too, like those of all Quintaglios, must have been obsidian black.<br>Above the Prophet, glowing faintly across the length of the sky, ran the powdery reflection of the great River that Land sailed on in its never-ending journey toward the Face of God. At least, that was what old Saleed said the dusty pathway of light crossing the night was, but he'd never been able to explain to Afsan's satisfaction why it was only during certain times that the great River cast a reflection on the sky.<br>Saleed! Abominable Saleed! It had taken Afsan fifty-five days riding atop a domesticated hornface in one of the merchant caravans to get from Pack Carno, part of the province of Arj'toolar, deep within Land's interior, to Capital City on the upriver shore of Land.<br>The children were the children of the Pack, of course--only the creche operators knew who Afsan's actual parents might have been--and the whole Pack was proud that one of their own had been selected to apprentice to the court astrologer. The choice, presumably, had been made based on Afsan's showing in the most recent battery of vocational exams. He had felt honored as he packed his sashes and boots, his books and astrolabe, and set out for his selected future. But he had been here for almost five hundred days now. True, that was something of a record. As he had discovered after arriving here, Saleed had had six other apprentices in the last four kilodays, all of whom had been dismissed. But, even though he seemed to have greater endurance than the previous tryouts, Afsan's dream of contributing to the advancement of astrological research had been smashed by his master.<br>Afsan had idolized Saleed, devouring his books on portents and omens, his treatise on the reflected River in the sky, his articles on the significance of each constellation. How he had looked forward to meeting the great one! How disappointed he had been when that day finally came. Soon, though, Afsan would be leaving on his pilgrimage. He thanked God for that, for he'd be away from his master for a great many days--able to study in private, free from Saleed's critical scowl.<br>Afsan shook his head slightly, again clearing his thoughts. He'd come here to bask in the beauty of the night, not to wallow in his own misfortune. One day the stars would yield their secrets to him.<br>Time slipped by unnoticed as Afsan drank in the glory overhead. Moons careened across the sky, waxing and waning as they went. The stars rose and fell, constellations hustling across the firmament. Meteors flashed through the night, tiny streaks of gold against the black. Nothing gave Afsan more pleasure than ...<br><br></p><h2>Gardening for Beginners IR</h2><p>This delightful book is packed with simple and straightforward growing projects specially chosen for beginner gardeners.

By now the boy who ran from barbarian invaders is both knight of Valdemar and a master mage; he is governor of a small province and in love with Keisha who returns his feelings, but he still has problems and responsibilities. For one thing, he has never solved the mystery of what happened to his parents. For another, Keisha refuses to marry him lest his role as governor and hers of healer come into conflict--and there are still barbarians beyond the border who threaten one day to come back.<p> The story of how these problems are all resolved is told in a quiet tone unusual in this sort of epic fantasy. Darian has as much to look within for the solution to these issues as to struggle in the outside world. The woodland journey during which he does this is much of the time a celebration of the renewal of the human soul by the natural world.</p><p> Lackey and Dixon have found a courtly, meditative way of telling an attractively simple story.

In this provocative new book, historians Burton W. Folsom, Jr., and Anita Folsom make a compelling case that FDR&#x2019;s presidency led to evasive and self-serving wartime policies. <br><br>At a time when most Americans held isolationist sentiments&#x2014;a backlash against the stunning carnage of World War I&#x2014;Roosevelt secretly favored an aggressive interventionist foreign policy. Yet, throughout the 1930s, he spent lavishly on his disastrous New Deal programs and slashed defense spending, leaving America vastly unprepared for Japan&#x2019;s attack on Pearl Harbor and the challenge of fighting World War II. <br><br>History books tell us the wartime economy was a boon, thanks to massive government spending. But the skyrocketing national debt, food rations, nonexistent luxuries, crippling taxes, labor strikes, and dangerous work of the time tell a different story&#x2014;one that is hardly the stuff of recovery. <br><br>Instead, the war ushered in a new era of imperialism for the executive branch. Roosevelt seized private property, conducted illegal wiretaps, tried to silence domestic opposition, and interned 110,000 Japanese Americans. He set a dangerous precedent for entangling alliances in foreign affairs, including his remarkable courtship of Russian dictator Joseph Stalin, while millions of Americans showed the courage, perseverance, and fortitude to make the weapons and fight the war. <br><br>Was Roosevelt a great wartime leader, as historians almost unanimously assert?

These emphatically objective photographs from the years of the Kaisers, the Weimar Republic, the Nazi regime, and the early Federal Republic make up an unprecedented document of both the individual and the collective recent history of the Germans.<br> <br> Sander had intended to create a rank ordered portrait collection of the German people, an ambitious undertaking which remained incomplete at the time of his death. This reconstruction by Ulrich Keller, professor of art history at the University of California at Santa Barbara, in collaboration with Gunther Sander, the photographer's son, has been compiled from Sander's notes and negatives.<br> <br> Keller's introductory essay discusses the development of Sander's photographic aesthetic, his studio practices, his notions of class structure, his technical virtuosity, and his approach to portraiture. The 431 photographs following Keller's text are presented in 45 portfolios each divided into seven sections on farmers, workers, women, occupations, artists, the big city, and the last people.</p><p>born in 1876 in Herdorf Sieg, Germany, <b>August Sander</b> began his portrait work in the early 1890s. In 1904 he opened a portrait studio in Linz, but many of his images were made in the homes and places of employment of his sisters. His book <i>Antlitz der Zeit</i> (Face of the Time, 1929) was the first volume of a proposed extended portrait series. But his photography was driven from the market place by the Gestapo and the printing plates were destroyed. Seeking refuge from the storms of war, sander retreated to Westerwald. Slowly recognition of his achievements came his way in the form of state and international honors. He died in 1964 at age eighty-eight in Cologne.<br>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Customs in Common: Studies in Traditional Popular Culture</h2><p><i>Customs in Common</i> is the remarkable sequel to E.P. Thompson&#x2019;s influential, landmark volume of social history, <i>The Making of the English Working Class</i>. The product of years of research and debate, <i>Customs in Common</i> describes the complex culture from which working class institutions emerged in England a panoply of traditions and customs that the new working class fought to preserve well into Victorian times.<br> <br>In a text marked by both empathy and erudition, Thompson investigates the gradual disappearance of a range of cultural customs against the backdrop of the great upheavals of the eighteenth century. As villagers were subjected to a legal system increasingly hostile to custom, they tried both to resist and to preserve tradition, becoming, as Thompson explains, rebellious, but rebellious in defence of custom.&#x201d; Although some historians have written of riotous peasants of England and Wales as if they were mainly a problem for magistrates and governments, for Thompson it is the rulers, landowners, and governments who were a problem for the people, whose exuberant culture preceded the formation of working-class institutions and consciousness.<br> <br>Using a wide range of sources, Thompson shows how careful attention to fragmentary evidence helps to decode the fascinating symbolism of shaming rituals including rough music,&#x201d; and practices such as the ritual divorce known as wife sale.&#x201d; And in examining the vigorous presence of women in food riots from the sixteenth century onwards, he sheds further light on gender relations of the time.<br> <br>Essential reading for all those intrigued by English history, <i>Customs in Common</i> has a special relevance today, as traditional economies are being replaced by market economies throughout the world. The rich scholarship and depth of insight in Thompson&#x2019;s work offer many clues to understanding contemporary changes around the globe.<br></p><p><b>E.P. Thompson</b> (1924&#x2013;1993)was one of England's foremost historians and social critics. He was the author of many books, including The Making of the English Working Class and Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law, published by The New Press."By providing a fuller sense of the way of life capitalism destroyed, <i>Customs in Common</i> helps us understand why the resistance to it was so protracted and tenacious. ... [This] long-awaited collection ... is a signal contribution ... [from] the person most responsible for inspiring the revival of American labor history during the past thirty years."<br>&#x2014;Michael Merrill, <i>The Nation</i> <br> <br>"This book signals the return to historical writing of one of the most eloquent, powerful and independent voices of our time.

He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i> when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals. Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental. Several of his novels have been filmed by American and French directors, resulting in classic noir including <b>The Killer Inside Me</b> (1952), <b>After Dark My Sweet</b> (1955), and <b>The Grifters</b> (1963).This Thompson duo, first published in 1967 and 1965, respectively, offer the usual bevy of crooked, doublecrossing low-lifes his fans have come to love.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bill Evans: Everything Happens to Me: A Musical Biography</h2><p>A Grammy winner and pioneer of multi-track jazz recording, Bill Evans was the pianist on Miles Davis' classic <i>Kind of Blue</i> album and a key figure in the development of modern jazz piano.

A recipient of both a MacArthur Foundation "genius" award and a Prix de Rome, Hammons places himself as an artist between <i>Arte Povera </i>and Marcel Duchamp. He makes his art from refuse and the detritus of African-American life: chicken wings, Thunderbird and Night Train bottles, clippings from dreadlocks, basketball hoops. Hammons's deeply felt political views on race and cultural stereotypes give his witty and elegant sculptures, installations, and body prints an integrity that promises to keep the focus on his art rather than on his career.<br> <br> Illustrated with nearly 100 photographs (both black and white and color), <i>Rousing the Rubble </i>covers the full range of Hammons's art and his methods of creating it. Steve Cannon's rap poem takes the reader on a freewheeling bicycle ride from Harlem to the Lower East Side in New York and is joyously infused with the same energies and inspirations as Hammons' work. Tom Finkelpearl discusses the power of the dirty, used objects Hammons prefers and how they relate to the clean" art exhibited in conventional gallery settings. And Kellie Jones examines how Hammons's art evolved from Los Angeles in the 1960s to New York and Rome in the present day.</p><p>The title of this book exemplifies an old problem in both the art and publishing worlds: how established institutions can present an artist whose most important claims are founded on a criticism of and independence from such institutions without mitigating those claims. Hammons's work avoids the trap of marginality by using an iconography and methodology springing from and presented within his urban African American context. Though he has made plenty of works imbued with art-historical references--works subsequently installed at the Venice Bieniele and at hip galleries--these are his marginalia instead of his crowning crossover accomplishments. Even more surprising than the artist's ability to control the spin of his work is this book's success in conveying Hammons's art in its original environment--which most readers will find alien. Three contrasting essays--a traditional retrospective, a 'rap-poem' evoking both the physical and psychic New York, and an essay "On the Ideology of Dirt"--encourage readers to focus on "the questions suggested by the work itself." Highly recommended for all contemporary American art collections. --Eric Bryant, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.<br> <br> "David Hammons's gifts are many and wondrous.... There's a joyous, modest, offhand quality to much of his work. Yet beneath the congenial exterior is a tough and incisive view of the world, for Mr. Hammons is fundamentally a political artist whose works address issues of black history, African culture, racism, drug addiction and poverty with the compassion and something of the complexity demanded by these issues. He is one of the most engaging and interesting artists working today."<br> &#x2014;<b>Michael Kimmelman</b>, The New York Times</p><h2>Flowers and Foul Play: A Magic Garden Mystery</h2><p><b>Fiona Knox lost her fiance&#x301; and her flower shop&#x2014;but when she flies to Scotland to inherit her godfather&#x2019;s cottage and possibly magical walled garden, she may lose her life as well when she&#x2019;s swept into a murder investigation.</b><br><br>Florist Fiona Knox&#x2019;s life isn&#x2019;t smelling so sweet these days.

But just to make sure, to know exactly how much time he had, he shot a quick look over his shoulder and saw that the<br>Hollins Hills&#x2019; nose tackle had cleared Malcolm Burnley, Nate&#x2019;s center and the best blocker Valley had, on an outside route and was coming hard, thinking he might have a shot at getting his first sack of the day.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nate knew he didn&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;<br>In no hurry, Nate kept moving toward the sideline, toward the Valley bench, almost feeling as if he were floating. Having cleared the pocket completely, a nice patch of open green waited for him a few yards in front of Coach Rivers.<br>&nbsp;<br>He stopped now, planting, making sure to square his shoulders so he didn&#x2019;t drop his arm angle and sidearm the ball, setting himself on his back foot, carrying the ball high. The throwing mechanics that Coach said you pretty much had to be born with.<br>&nbsp;<br>And he let the ball rip.<br>&nbsp;<br>Knowing that the cornerback who had been covering Pete was never going to catch up with him and that the Hollins Hills safety had no chance of getting over to the sideline in time.<br>&nbsp;<br>He watched the ball like it was on a string, like one of those perfect casts his dad used to make across the water when the two of them still had time to go fishing together, before his dad began working all the time.<br>&nbsp;<br>He hoped his mom was getting this on the video recorder that was on its last legs and had been for a while, because his dad&#x2014;working a double shift on Saturdays now&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t here to see it in person.<br>&nbsp;<br>The ball came down into Pete Mullaney&#x2019;s hands, Pete in perfect stride, just crossing the Hollins Hills 10-yard line.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pete pressed the ball to the front of his white uniform with those sure hands of his and crossed the goal line. Then he turned and just tossed the ball to the referee, because if you played on a team with Nate Brodie, if he was the one throwing you the ball, you knew enough not to do some kind of crazy touchdown dance afterward.<br>&nbsp;<br>You could be happy, just not happy enough to show the other team up.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nate was running down the sideline now, almost as fast as Pete just had. All the things that were confusing about his thirteen-year-old life lately&#x2014;the things that made him sad and just plain mad once he got away from a football field&#x2014;Nate had left them all in his dust.<br>By the time Nate got to Pete, the little wide receiver was on the Valley sideline, waiting for him with his arms stretched wide. Nate, taller than Pete by a whole helmet, grabbed him, picked him up, put him down just as quickly, as much celebration as he was going to allow himself, mostly because there was still some game left to play.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pete said, &#x201c;That throw was legit.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You always say that,&#x201d; Nate said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, Brady, this time I really mean it. That throw was, like, righteous.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Nate laughed now, couldn&#x2019;t help it. &#x201c;I had the wind behind me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Pete Mullaney shook his head, smiling from behind his face mask. &#x201c;Dude,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;as far as I can tell, your arm is pretty much where the wind starts.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Nate ran over to Coach Rivers then, to get the play Coach wanted them to run on the conversion. Then he ran back on the field and told his teammates he was faking to LaDell and then taking it in himself, on a roll to his left.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nobody touched him. Valley was up 22&#x2013;7. They all knew the game was over, even with the clock showing two minutes, straight up, left.<br>&nbsp;<br>He and Pete ran off the field together, knowing that the forty-yarder they&#x2019;d just hooked up on had put this one in the books.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Nate got back to the bench, Coach Rivers gave him a simple handshake.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A Brady throw all the way,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I wish,&#x201d; Nate said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; Coach said. &#x201c;Biggest throw of the season.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>For now, Nate thought.<br>&nbsp;<br>For now.</p><h2>The Key of Solomon the King: Clavicula Salomonis</h2><p>This most celebrated of all magical textbooks, believed to be written by King Solomon himself, details the processes for summoning and mastering the spirits.

Sheer reporterly skill, however, sometimes gets in the way of structure and plot. A barrage of authentic dialogue casts the lives of Raheim ``Pooquie'' Rivers, a bicycle messenger, and Mitchell ``Little Bit'' Crawford, a journalist, in high relief: The men are still in love and still contending with the significant differences both between their individual cultures and more particularly between the gay black and white worlds. Raheim is raising his young son, ``L'il Brotha Man,'' while remaining conflicted about his sexuality. He hasn't been able to shake his hand-grenade temper and appetite for lapsing into African-American hypermasculine poses, despite the fact that his homosexuality is becoming more visible. Interspersed throughout are chapters labeled ``Rewind,'' which offer glimpses of Raheim's former life--the birth of his son, for instance, plus a few saucy meditations, delivered in serious slang, on the pleasures of the flesh. In quick succession, Raheim becomes a male model and learns that his father is not, as he was led to believe, dead. A poignant moment follows in which Raheim has to explain this fact to L'il Brotha Man; Raheim's courage, both at rebelling against his father's example and sticking by L'il Brotha Man, and at working on his relationship with Mitchell, emphasize Hardy's upbeat attitude toward black-family alternatives. The story's tied up rather too tidily at the end, and Hardy doesn't always succeed in masking a thin plot with electrifying dialogue, but the characters--and their language--virtually jump off the page. Hardy manages to combine unself-conscious sentiment and blistering emotion in voices that refocus gay and African-American storytelling. A thoroughly fresh presence in an increasingly crowded field. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The Second Time Around is the sequel to B-Boy Blues, Hardy's hugely successful first "Africentric" gay hip-hop novel. Raheim Rivers is back, and he's trying to pick up the pieces and carry on with his life. The narrative is mostly dialogue?either Raheim's conversations with himself or with the people in his life?and it provides an engaging, immediate window to Raheim's character and his dawning maturity. The novel begins with and is centered around Raheim's reconciliation with his lover, Little Bit, who left him after Raheim hit him in a fit of jealousy. Through a series of flashbacks to his youth, readers learn what made Raheim the man he is now?a black man in love with another black man, not entirely out of the closet, prone to bursts of verbal violence and, most importantly, a man with an enormous capacity for love and for learning from his mistakes. Added to Raheim's struggle to win back Little Bit's trust are the complexities of co-raising his son, L'il Brotha Man. Raheim is determined to be a better father to his son than the one who left him and his mother behind. Things move in cycles of beginnings and endings, from Raheim's burgeoning modeling career to L'il Brotha Man's graduation from kindergarten. The result is an upbeat tale which, while confronting issues of violence, racism and homophobia, is romantic, absolutely sensual and downright funny. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Birthday Book: An Old Fashioned Keepbook: Dates to Remember Forever</h2><p>Keeps track of birthdays</p><p></p><h2>Curious George and the Pizza</h2><p>Curious George is up to his elbows in dough and trouble as he tries his hand at making pizza.

In this engrossing and important new work, eminent historian David Landes explores the complex, fascinating and often startling causes of the wealth and poverty of nations. The answers are found not only in the large forces at work in economies: geography, religion, the broad swings of politics, but also in the small surprising details. In Europe, the invention of spectacles doubled the working life of skilled craftsmen, and played a prominent role in the creation of articulated machines, and in China, the failure to adopt the clock fundamentally hindered economic development. The relief of poverty is vital to the survival of us all. As David Landes brilliantly shows, the key to future success lies in understanding the lessons the past has to teach us - lessons uniquely imparted in this groundbreaking and vital book which exemplifies narrative history at its best.</p><p>Professor David S. Landes takes a historic approach to the analysis of the distribution of wealth in this landmark study of world economics. Landes argues that the key to today&#39;s disparity between the rich and poor nations of the world stems directly from the industrial revolution, in which some countries made the leap to industrialization and became fabulously rich, while other countries failed to adapt and remained poor. Why some countries were able to industrialize and others weren&#39;t has been the subject of much heated debate over the decades; climate, natural resources, and geography have all been put forward as explanations--and are all brushed aside by Landes in favor of his own controversial theory: that the ability to effect an industrial revolution is dependent on certain cultural traits, without which industrialization is impossible to sustain. Landes contrasts the characteristics of successfully industrialized nations--work, thrift, honesty, patience, and tenacity--with those of nonindustrial countries, arguing that until these values are internalized by all nations, the gulf between the rich and poor will continue to grow.David Landes is an economist who has enjoyed a distinguished academic career which includes senior posts at Columbia University and Harvard. He has both written and edited a great deal, and his work has been published in the States and Europe.</p><h2>The Barbary Corsairs: Warfare in the Mediterranean, 1480-1580</h2><p>The Barbary Corsairs first appeared to terrorize shipping in the 16th century. These Muslim pirates sailed out of the ports of North Africa and, acting as officers of the sprawling Ottoman Empire, plundered the trading routes of the Mediterranean and sowed horror in the hearts of Christians everywhere. The most famous and powerful were the Barbarossa brothers, sons of a renegade Christian. The true founders of the Algiers regency, they initially preyed on fishing vessels or defenseless merchantmen before growing bolder and embarking upon more brazen expeditions - attacking fortified ports and cities; raiding and kidnapping inhabitants of the African coast; and hunting ships from the Christian nations. In this newly translated book, Jacques Heers follows the extraordinary exploits of the brothers, and those of other corsairs and profiteers, set against the turbulent backdrop of trade, commerce and conflict throughout the Mediterranean during the 14th - 16th centuries. It&#39;s an enthralling adventure, robustly written, and it brings to life an age when travel and trade were perilous enterprises.</p><p>Though this translated volume on Renaissance maritime history is slow to get into, its colorful, well-documented subject ultimately rewards the serious reader. After a brief history of trade and piracy in the medieval Mediterranean, the book focuses on the area's "Golden Age of Piracy." For much of the period between the fall of Constantinople (1453) and the Spanish Armada (1588), the "pirates" of Tunis and Algiers were actually vassals of the Ottoman Sultans who sent to sea regular war fleets numbering in the dozens or hundreds. They had a major strategic impact on the Mediterranean wars of the Renaissance, as they were often allies of the French, fighting against alleged "encirclement" by the Habsburg Empire of Spain. This in turn made the Spanish their implacable foes, and began a French tradition of looking benignly on the Turks that lasted at least two centuries. In addition to the diplomatic background, Heers, a professor at the Sorbonne, sketches in Barbary leaders (like the best known, Khaireddin Barbarossa, many were converts to Islam or the sons of such), slavery, trade negotiations, Spanish settlements in Africa, and the literature spawned by the Barbary wars. One wishes that the notes and bibliography had been translated from the French along with the main text, but otherwise this volume will satisfy those interested in maritime history not often covered in English-language sources. The cover's colorful portrait of galley fleets in action matches Heers's good selection of historical illustrations. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Africans: A Triple Heritage</h2><p>Looks at the history, geography, and culture of Africa, assesses native, Arab, and Western influences, and discusses sports, religion, government, and social issues in Africa</p><p>In stressing Africa's unique culture as a product of three major influences (Islamic, Western, and indigenous), political scientist Mazrui points out that the West has tended to regard Africa as recipient rather than as transmitter of effects. Yet Africa has transformed both Europe and America in the past, and the difficult situation in which Africa finds itself today (economically dependent, culturally mixed, and politically unstable) is the price it has had to pay for Western development. This companion volume to the controversial TV series is thought-provoking for the author's frank and outspoken manner of presenting the facts as well as for the facts themselves. The book is chock full of information and unique ideas, has beautiful pictures, and should be read both by experts and laypeople. Recommended for public as well as university collections. Louise Leonard, Univ. of Florida Lib., Gainesville<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Originally issued in connection with a PBS series, this volume by the Kenyan political scientist offers a stimulating introduction to Africa's peoples and problems.

It's the most brutal degradation of the human form that the squad has ever uncovered. Caffery's well-deserved reputation is that of the most stoic of detectives, but his initial inspection of the corpse will forever sear his psyche.<br><br>One by one, four more corpses are discovered only steps away from the first. Five bodies, all young women, all ritualistically murdered with cunning precision. And when a postmortem examination reveals a singular, macabre signature linking the victims, Caffery realizes that he's facing the most dangerous offender known to the force: a sexual serial killer.<br><br>In the murky recesses of his own mind, Caffery harbors the haunting legacy of a loved one's slaying.&nbsp;&nbsp;What baffles him is that not a single missing person's report has been filed for any of the five young women. How has the Birdman chosen these seemingly perfect victims?<br><br>Now, as he employs every weapon forensic science can offer, Caffery knows that time is running out before the killer strikes again, and that he must put away his tortured past in order to safeguard the Birdman's next prey.<br><br>With refined craft and beguiling imagination, Mo Hayder is certain to skip the hearts of the most demanding readers of crime fiction.</p><p>This crackling psychological thriller introduces police detective Jack Caffery, who is on the hunt for a serial killer the British tabloids have nicknamed "The Millennium Ripper." <p>The Ripper is behind the murder of five prostitutes, whose bodies are unearthed beneath the rubble of a Greenwich landfill. All the victims have been raped and their bodies horrendously mutilated--but not until after being killed by a dose of heroin injected directly into their brainstems. What stuns Caffery even more is the one detail of the murders the public doesn't know; the hearts of the women have been replaced with live birds sewn into the victims' chests. </p><p>Caffery himself is a tortured man, still burdened by guilt over the decades-old murder of his younger brother and frustrated because he cannot bring the man he knows is responsible to the bar of justice. When the Millennium Ripper confesses to the prostitute killings just before taking his own life, Caffery faces his own limitations and begins to make peace with his past. But then another prostitute is found dead, her body ravaged in the same way, a bird where her heart was--and Caffery realizes that his past may never truly be put to rest. </p><p>A solid page turner, this gripping debut by a young Englishwoman introduces a complex and fascinating protagonist destined for another appearance.

Josef Albers drew on over forty years' work in a variety of media&#x2014;woodcuts, sandblasted glass pictures, and oil paintings&#x2014;for these poetic explorations of color and form. Created just four years before his death in 1976, the images can be seen as the summation of Albers's creative life.<br><br>Albers was a student and a teacher at the Bauhaus from 1920 to 1933, escaped to America and taught at Black Mountain College until 1949, and was chairman of the Department of Design at Yale University until 1958. As both artist and teacher he influenced innumerable artists, including Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, and Robert Rauschenberg. Albers's seminal text, <i>Interaction of Color</i> (1963), which was translated into eight languages, affected art teaching all over the world.<br><br>This book embodies all the elements of Albers's lifetime preoccupation with abstraction, color, and perception. He draws the viewer into a dynamic relationship with his work, showing how color can have deceptive and unpredictable effects, depending on how it interacts with other colors. The order of the 127 illustrations was carefully chosen by Albers so that they can be examined and appreciated for their visual interaction or as beautiful works of art in their own right. They appear alone on the page, in pairs, or sometimes four together.<br><br>The accompanying text includes key passages from Albers's own writings, printed on special foldout sections, and the introduction by noted critic T.

The wound stung like fuck, but it wasn&#x2019;t as bad as some I&#x2019;d had. The blaster bolt came in blind across my ribs, already weakened by the door plating it had to chew through to get to me. Priests, up against the slammed door and looking for a quick gut shot. Fucking amateur night. They&#x2019;d probably caught almost as much pain themselves from the point-blank blowback off the plating. Behind the door, I was already twisting aside. What was left of the charge plowed a long, shallow gash across my rib cage and went out, smoldering in the folds of my coat. Sudden ice down that side of my body and the abrupt stench of fried skin-sensor components. That curious bone-splinter fizzing that&#x2019;s almost a taste, where the bolt had ripped through the biolube casing on the floating ribs.<br><br> Eighteen minutes later, by the softly glowing display chipped into my upper left field of vision, the same fizzing was still with me as I hurried down the lamplit street, trying to ignore the wound. Stealthy seep of fluids beneath my coat. Not much blood.

He blinked wave-tattooed eyelids in a dismissive flutter that said your loss and leaned his tightly muscled frame languidly back into the gloom. I crossed the street and took the corner, tacking between a couple more whores, one a woman, the other of indeterminate gender. The woman was an augment, forked dragon tongue flickering out around her overly prehensile lips, maybe tasting my wound on the night air. Her eyes danced a similar passage over me, then slid away. On the other side, the cross-gender pro shifted its stance slightly and gave me a quizzical look but said nothing. Neither was interested. The streets were rain-slick and deserted, and they&#x2019;d had longer to see me coming than the doorway operator. I&#x2019;d cleaned up since leaving the citadel, but something about me must have telegraphed the lack of business opportunity.<br><br> At my back, I heard them talking about me in Stripjap. I heard the word for broke.<br><br> They could afford to be choosy. In the wake of the Mecsek Initiative, business was booming. Tekitomura was packed that winter, thronging with salvage brokers and the deCom crews that drew them the way a trawler wake draws ripwings. Making New Hok Safe for a New Century, the ads went. From the newly built hoverloader dock down at the Kompcho end of town it was less than a thousand kilometers, straight-line distance, to the shores of New Hokkaido, and the &#x2019;loaders were running day and night. Outside of an airdrop, there is no faster way to get across the Andrassy Sea. And on Harlan&#x2019;s World, you don&#x2019;t go up in the air if you can possibly avoid it. Any crew toting heavy equipment&#x2014;and they all were&#x2014;was going to New Hok on a hoverloader out of Tekitomura. Those that lived would be coming back the same way.<br><br> Boomtown. Bright new hope and brawling enthusiasm as the Mecsek money poured in. I limped down thoroughfares littered with the detritus of spent human merriment. In my pocket, the freshly excised cortical stacks clicked together like dice.<br><br> There was a fight going on at the intersection of Pencheva Street and Muko Prospect. The pipe houses on Muko had just turned out and their synapse-fried patrons had met late-shift dockworkers coming up through the decayed quiet of the warehouse quarter. More than enough reason for violence. Now a dozen badly coordinated figures stumbled back and forth in the street, flailing and clawing inexpertly at each other while a gathered crowd shouted encouragement. One body already lay inert on the fused-glass paving, and someone else was dragging their body, a limb&#x2019;s length at a time, out of the fray, bleeding. Blue sparks shorted off a set of overcharged power knuckles; elsewhere light glimmered on a blade. But everyone still standing seemed to be having a good time, and there were no police as yet.<br><br> Yeah, part of me jeered. Probably all too busy up the hill right now.<br><br> I skirted the action as best I could, shielding my injured side.

Something of a role model for me, though it was several decades since I&#x2019;d last seen her. On a dozen different worlds, she crept into my mind unbidden, and I owed that ghost in my head my own life a dozen times over. This time I didn&#x2019;t need her or the knife. I got past the fight without eye contact, made the corner of Pencheva, and melted into the shadows that lay across the alley mouths on the seaward side of the street. The timechip in my eye said I was late.<br><br> Pick it up, Kovacs. According to my contact in Millsport, Plex wasn&#x2019;t all that reliable at the best of times, and I hadn&#x2019;t paid him enough to wait long.<br><br> Five hundred meters down and then left into the tight fractal whorls of Belacotton Kohei Section, named centuries ago for the habitual content and the original owner-operator family whose warehouse frontages walled the curving maze of alleys. With the Unsettlement and the subsequent loss of New Hokkaido as any kind of market, the local belaweed trade pretty much collapsed and families like Kohei went rapidly bankrupt. Now the grime-filmed upper-level windows of their fa�ades peered sadly across at each other over gape-mouthed loading bay entrances whose shutters were all jammed somewhere uncommitted between open and closed.<br><br> There was talk of regeneration, of course, of reopening units like these and retooling them as deCom labs, training centers, and hardware storage facilities. Mostly, it was still just talk&#x2014;the enthusiasm had kindled on the wharf-line units facing the hoverloader ramps farther west, but so far it hadn&#x2019;t spread farther in any direction than you could trust a wirehead with your phone. This far off the wharf and this far east, the chitter of Mecsek finance was still pretty inaudible.<br><br> The joys of trickledown.<br><br> Belacotton Kohei Nine Point Twenty-six showed a faint glow in one upper window, and the long restless tongues of shadows in the light that seeped from under the half-cranked loading bay shutter gave the building the look of a one-eyed, drooling maniac. I slid to the wall and dialed up the synthetic sleeve&#x2019;s auditory circuits for what they were worth, which wasn&#x2019;t much. Voices leaked out into the street, fitful as the shadows at my feet.<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;telling you, I&#x2019;m not going to hang around for that.&#x201d;<br><br> It was a Millsport accent, the drawling metropolitan twang of Harlan&#x2019;s World Amanglic dragged up to an irritated jag. Plex&#x2019;s voice, muttering below sense-making range, made soft provincial counterpoint. He seemed to be asking a question.<br><br> &#x201c;How the fuck would I know that? Believe what you want.&#x201d; Plex&#x2019;s companion was moving about, handling things. His voice faded back in the echoes of the loading bay. I caught the words kaikyo, matter, a chopped laugh. Then again, coming closer to the shutter, &#x201c;&#x2014;matters is what the family believes, and they&#x2019;ll believe what the technology tells them. Technology leaves a trail, my friend.&#x201d; A sharp coughing and indrawn breath that sounded like recreational chemicals going down. &#x201c;This guy is fucking late.&#x201d;<br><br> I frowned. Kaikyo has a lot of meanings, but they all depend on how old you are. Geographically, it&#x2019;s a strait or a channel. That&#x2019;s early-Settlement-years use, or just hypereducated, kanji-scribbling, First Families pretension. This guy didn&#x2019;t sound First Family, but there was no reason he couldn&#x2019;t have been around back when Konrad Harlan and his well-connected pals were turning Glimmer VI into their own personal backyard. Plenty of DH personalities still on stack from that far back, just waiting to be downloaded into a working sleeve. Come to that, you wouldn&#x2019;t need to resleeve more than half a dozen times, end-to-end, to live through the whole of Harlan&#x2019;s World&#x2019;s human history anyway. It&#x2019;s still not much over four centuries, Earth-standard, since the colony barges made planetfall.<br><br> Envoy intuition twisted about in my head. It felt wrong. I&#x2019;d met men and women with centuries of continuous life behind them, and they didn&#x2019;t talk like this guy. This wasn&#x2019;t the wisdom of ages, drawling out into the Tekitomura night over pipe fumes.<br><br> On the street, scavenged into the argot of Stripjap a couple of hundred years later, kaikyo means a contact who can shift stolen goods. A covert flow manager. In some parts of the Millsport Archipelago, it&#x2019;s still common usage. Elsewhere, the meaning is shifting to describe aboveboard financial consultants.<br><br> Yeah, and farther south it means a holy man possessed by spirits, or a sewage outlet. Enough of this detective shit. You heard the man&#x2014;you&#x2019;re late.<br><br> I got the heel of one hand under the edge of the shutter and hauled upward, locking up the tidal rip of pain from my wound as well as the synthetic sleeve&#x2019;s nervous system would let me. The shutter ratcheted noisily to the roof. Light fell out into the street and all over me.<br><br> &#x201c;Evening.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; The Millsport accent jerked back a full step. He&#x2019;d been only a couple of meters away from the shutter when it went up.<br><br> &#x201c;Tak.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, Plex.&#x201d; My eyes stayed on the newcomer. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the tan?&#x201d;<br><br> By then I already knew. Pale, tailored good looks straight out of some low-end experia flick, somewhere between Micky Nozawa and Ryu Bartok. Well-proportioned fighter&#x2019;s sleeve, bulk in the shoulders and chest, length in the limbs. Stacked hair, the way they&#x2019;re doing it on the bioware catwalks these days, that upward static-twisted thing that&#x2019;s meant to look like they just pulled the sleeve out of a clone tank. A suit bagged and draped to suggest hidden weaponry, a stance that said he had none he was ready to use. Combat arts crouch that was more bark than readiness to bite. He still had the discharged micropipe in one curled palm, and his pupils were spiked wide open. Concession to an ancient tradition put illuminum-tattooed curlicues across one corner of his forehead.<br><br> Millsport yakuza apprentice. Street thug.<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t call me tani,&#x201d; he hissed. &#x201c;You are the outsider here, Kovacs. You are the intruder.&#x201d;<br><br> I left him at the periphery of my vision and looked toward Plex, who was over by the workbenches, fiddling with a knot of webbing straps and trying on a smile that didn&#x2019;t want to be on his dissipated aristo face.<br><br> &#x201c;Look, Tak&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This was strictly a private party, Plex. I didn&#x2019;t ask you to subcontract the entertainment.&#x201d;<br><br> The yakuza twitched forward, barely restrained. He made a grating noise deep in his throat. Plex looked panicked.<br><br> &#x201c;Wait, I . . .&#x201d; He put down the webbing with an obvious effort. &#x201c;Tak, he&#x2019;s here about something else.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s here on my time,&#x201d; I said mildly.<br><br> &#x201c;Listen, Kovacs. You fucking&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; I looked back at him as I said it, hoping he could read the bright energy in my tone for what it was. &#x201c;You know who I am, you&#x2019;ll stay out of my way. I&#x2019;m here to see Plex, not you. Now get out.&#x201d;<br><br> I don&#x2019;t know what stopped him, Envoy rep, late-breaking news from the citadel&#x2014;because they&#x2019;ll be all over it by now, you made such a fucking mess up there&#x2014;or just a cooler head than the cheap-suited punk persona suggested. He stood braced in the door of his own rage for a moment, then stood down and displaced it, all poured into a glance at the nails of his right hand and a grin.<br><br> &#x201c;Sure. You just go ahead and transact with Plex here. I&#x2019;ll wait outside. Shouldn&#x2019;t take long.&#x201d;<br><br> He even took the first step toward the street. I looked back at Plex.<br><br> &#x201c;What the fuck&#x2019;s he talking about?&#x201d;<br><br> Plex winced.<br><br> &#x201c;We, uh, we need to reschedule, Tak. We can&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh no.&#x201d; But looking around the room I could already see the swirled patterns in the dust where someone had been using a grav lifter. &#x201c;No, no, you told me&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I-I know, Tak, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I paid you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you the money&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want the fucking money, Plex.&#x201d; I stared at him, fighting down the urge to rip his throat out. Without Plex, there was no upload. Without the upload&#x2014;&#x201c;I want my fucking body back.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s cool, it&#x2019;s cool. You&#x2019;ll get it back. It&#x2019;s just right now&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just right now, Kovacs, we&#x2019;re using the facilities.&#x201d; The yakuza drifted back into my line of sight, still grinning. &#x201c;Because to tell the truth, they were pretty much ours in the first place. But then Plex here probably didn&#x2019;t tell you that, did he?&#x201d;<br><br> I shuttled a glance between them. Plex looked embarrassed.<br><br> You gotta feel sorry for the guy. Isa, my Millsport contact broker, all of fifteen years old, razored violet hair and brutally obvious archaic datarat plugs, working on world-weary reflective while she laid out the deal and the cost. Look at history, man. It fucked him over but good.<br><br> History, it was true, didn&#x2019;t seem to have done Plex any favors. Born three centuries sooner with the name Kohei, he&#x2019;d have been a spoiled stupid younger son with no particular need to do more than exercise his obvious intelligence in some gentleman&#x2019;s pursuit like astrophysics or archaeologue science. As it was, the Kohei family had left its post-Unsettlement generations nothing but the keys to ten streets of empty warehouses and a decayed aristo charm that, in Plex&#x2019;s own self-deprecating words, made it easier than you&#x2019;d think to get laid when broke. Pipe-blasted, he told me the whole shabby story on less than three days&#x2019; acquaintance. He seemed to need to tell someone, and Envoys are good listeners. You listen, you file under local color, you soak it up. Later, the recalled detail maybe saves your life.<br><br> Driven by the terror of a single life span and no resleeve, Plex&#x2019;s newly impoverished ancestors learned to work for a living, but most of them weren&#x2019;t very good at it. Debt piled up; the vultures moved in. By the time Plex came along, his family were in so deep with the yakuza that low-grade criminality was just a fact of life. He&#x2019;d probably grown up around aggressively slouched suits like this one. Probably learned that embarrassed, give-up-the-ground smile at his father&#x2019;s knee.<br><br> The last thing he wanted to do was upset his patrons.<br><br> The last thing I wanted to do was ride a hoverloader back to Millsport in this sleeve.<br><br> &#x201c;Plex, I&#x2019;m booked out of here on the Saffron Queen. That&#x2019;s four hours away. Going to refund me my ticket?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll flicker it, Tak.&#x201d; His voice was pleading. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s another &#x2019;loader out to EmPee tomorrow evening. I&#x2019;ve got stuff, I mean Yukio&#x2019;s guys&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;use my fucking name, man,&#x201d; yelped the yakuza.<br><br> &#x201c;They can flicker you to the evening ride, no one&#x2019;s ever going to know.&#x201d; The pleading gaze turned on Yukio. &#x201c;Right? You&#x2019;ll do that, right?&#x201d;<br><br> I added a stare of my own. &#x201c;Right? Seeing as how you&#x2019;re fucking up my exit plans currently?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You already fucked up your exit, Kovacs.&#x201d; The yakuza was frowning, head-shaking. Playing at sempai with mannerisms and a clip-on solemnity he&#x2019;d probably copied directly from his own sempai not too far back in his apprenticeship. &#x201c;Do you know how much heat you&#x2019;ve got out there looking for you right now? The cops have put in sniffer squads all over uptown, and my guess is they&#x2019;ll be all over the &#x2019;loader dock inside an hour. The whole TPD is out to play. Not to mention our bearded stormtrooper friends from the citadel. Fuck, man, you think you could have left a little more blood up there.&#x201d; &#x201c;I asked you a question. I didn&#x2019;t ask for a critique. You going to flicker me to the next departure or not?&#x201d;</p><h2>Dagon and Other Macabre Tales</h2><p>Lovecraft&#39;s lesser fiction including the Tomb, Arthur Jermyn, The Moon-Bog, and The Lurking Fear is anthologized and supplemented by his long essay Supernatural Horror in Literature</p><p>This last volume of a trilogy represents the culmination of a monumental projectthe bringing into print of Lovecraft's stories in their definitive form, based on manuscripts and notes.

When their car breaks down on a Greenwich Village street, Evan&#x2019;s father presses a random doorbell, looking for a telephone. Within hours, two families&#x2014;sharing equally complex and addled histories&#x2014;will come together. There will be flirtation. There will be a marriage. There will be a child, a new home... But as Evan moves further into the uncharted land of manhood, as the women and men around him come into focus, he faces roads not taken and a journey not made&#x2014;in Richard Yates&#x2019; haunting exploration of human restlessness, family secrets, and a future shaped by them both.</p><p>A native New Yorker, Richard Yates was born in 1926; his first novel, <i>Revolutionary Road</i>, was a finalist for the National Book Award (in the same year as <i>The Moviegoer</i> and <i>Catch-22</i>). Much admired by peers, he was known during his lifetime as the foremost fiction writer of the post-war "age of anxiety." He published his last novel in 1986, and died in 1992.<i>1</i><br>All the sorrows of Evan Shepard&#x2019;s loutish adolescence were redeemed at seventeen, in 1935, when he fell in love with automobiles. His persistent bullying of weaker boys, his thick-witted ways of offending girls, his inept and embarrassing ventures into petty crime&#x2013;none of these things mattered any more, except as bad memories. He had found a high romance in driving fast and far, over most of Long Island, and he soon attained intimacy with the mechanical parts of any car he could get his hands on. For whole days at a time, meticulously taking a car apart or putting it together in the dust of his parents&#x2019; driveway, Evan would be lost to the world.<br><br>And it was always a pleasure for his father, Charles Shepard, just to stand at a window and watch him working alone out there in the sun. Nobody could have guessed a year ago that this particular boy would ever learn to organize and focus his mind on a useful job of work; and wasn&#x2019;t that the beginning of maturity? Wasn&#x2019;t it what helped a man develop will and purpose in his life?<br><br>Well, of course it was; and the aching, crying need for will and purpose in your life&#x2013;anybody&#x2019;s life&#x2013;was something Charles Shepard knew about from long and helpless experience. He was a retired army officer, a man with poetic habits of thought that he&#x2019;d always tried to suppress, and it often seemed that his own capacity for zeal had vanished with the Armistice of 1918.<br><br>As an impassioned young second lieutenant of infantry, newly married to the prettiest girl at the officers&#x2019; club dance and reasonably sure she would pray for him, he had arrived in France three days after the war ended&#x2013;and his disappointment was so intense that more than a few officers had to tell him, impatiently, not to be silly about it.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>not</i>,&#x201d; he would insist, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>not</i>.&#x201d; But he always knew there&#x2019;d be no escaping the truth; he had even begun to suspect that a queasy sense of abortion might haunt the rest of his life.<br><br>&#x201c;Apart from knowing I&#x2019;ll love you forever,&#x201d; he wrote to his wife from Le Havre, &#x201c;I seem to have lost confidence in just about everything else. I&#x2019;ve come to believe that only a very, very few matters in the world can ever be trusted to make sense.&#x201d;<br><br>Back in the States again and surrounded by whooping, hollering men who could scarcely wait to be out of the army, Charles came to an abrupt and unpopular decision. For reasons never entirely clear to himself, he signed up to stay in.<br><br>One way he could always tell the reasons weren&#x2019;t clear was that he had to keep going over and over them in his mind for years, as if they were answers in a dim little three-part catechism: the army could almost be seen as a vocation; it provided the security that a married man and a father would always need; and there might, eventually, be another war.<br><br>He served as a first lieutenant long enough to make him worry about being the oldest first lieutenant anyone knew, and almost all of his duties in those years, greatly against his wishes, lay in the heavy tedium of office work.<br><br>Fort Devens, Fort Dix, Fort Benning, Fort Meade&#x2013;every army post made brave attempts to be different from the others, but they were all the same. They were as plain as hell, and they were built on the assumption of obedience. Even in the closely guarded privacy of Married Officers&#x2019; Housing, and even at night, you could never forget where you were, or why, and neither could your wife. If everything in both your lives was expected to conform to the boundaries of a peacetime military preserve, and if your wife was as bright and spirited a girl as Grace Shepard, you could never honestly say you were surprised&#x2013;frightened, certainly, but not surprised&#x2013;when her nerves gave way and fell apart.<br><br>From the time of her first hospitalization Charles knew he had better make what plans he could for getting out of the army soon&#x2013;and by then there was another trouble that suggested he&#x2019;d be out of it soon enough anyway: his eyesight had gone rapidly bad and was getting worse. Ironically, though, it was during that same year that the army gave him something interesting to do. On being promoted to captain at last, he was placed in command of a rifle company.<br><br>And oh, he liked those two hundred men&#x2013;even the misfits; even the soreheads. After a very few weeks he was proud of them, and proud of seeming to have earned their respect. He savored those moments of every day that encouraged him to believe he was looking after them, taking care of them, and to believe they knew it; and he was never tired of hearing them say &#x201c;the captain,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the company commander.&#x201d;<br><br>When he took them out on long marches, under full field equipment, he liked the rhythm and the sweat and the disciplined pain of it, even though he might not always be sure he could make the distance. And there were other times, squinting and peering into their opened, empty Springfield rifles, while the men themselves stood unnaturally straight and perfectly still in formation, with perfectly expressionless faces, when he would find himself wishing he could lead this company into some fanciful war of his own imagining. Nearly all of them would distinguish themselves in the field because nearly every action there would be above and beyond the call of duty; then when the war was over their dead would come back to life again, just in time for the drinking and the laughter and the pretty girls.<br><br>If Grace had made a full recovery he might have tried to fake his way through any number of eye tests, just to stay with the company as long as possible, but there was no such luck. She had a second breakdown, and this time he knew he couldn&#x2019;t hesitate any longer. Even before she was out of the hospital he had made arrangements to resign his commission.<br><br>For several days, as they sorted out and packed their belongings, Charles toyed with the idea of moving to some place that neither of them had ever seen&#x2013;California, say, or Canada&#x2013;where they might both be rejuvenated in the bravery of starting a new life. But then, earlier Shepards had always been Long Island people, accustomed to grassy plains and potato farms and a wind smelling faintly of salt water, and so the more sensible thing was to go home. On the strength of his small but adequate retirement pension he bought a small but adequate brown frame house on the north shore, at the edge of the village of Cold Spring Harbor.<br><br>Before very long he was known around the village as a dignified, courteous man who always did his family&#x2019;s grocery shopping, and took care of their laundry, because his wife was said to be an invalid. There were hesitant, groundless rumors that he&#x2019;d been a hero in the war, or that he&#x2019;d served with some other kind of brilliance; people might have been surprised to learn that he&#x2019;d retired as a captain because his appearance and bearing were more in the style of a colonel: you could picture him taking salutes from a battalion or a whole regiment of men and sternly watching them pass in review. That impression might take on a faintly comic aspect sometimes, when you saw him wrestle and grapple on the street with grocery bags, or with laundry bags, his gray hair blown awry and his thick glasses beginning to slip down his nose; but nobody, even in the tavern, ever made jokes about him.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m back, dear,&#x201d; he called to Grace one afternoon, easing a great burden of groceries onto the kitchen table, and he continued talking to her in the same raised voice as he went about the business of putting things away where they belonged. &#x201c;I think Evan&#x2019;s been out there working on that engine for about ten hours straight,&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where he gets the energy. <i>Or</i> the diligence.&#x201d;<br><br>When he&#x2019;d finished with the groceries he broke out some ice and fixed two drinks of bourbon and water, one with a double shot of whiskey. He carried them into the living room and out onto a heavily shaded sun porch, where Grace reclined on a chaise longue, and he carefully put the one with the double bourbon into her waiting, reaching hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it remarkable how a boy can change? Just in a few months&#x2019; time?&#x201d; he asked her as he sat with his own drink on a straight chair, close beside her. The day had been tiring but he could rest for half an hour now, until it was time to get dinner started.<br><br>At certain moments, if the light and the alcohol worked to her advantage, Grace could still be the prettiest girl at the officers&#x2019; club dance. Charles had learned to wait for those moments with a lover&#x2019;s patience, and to cherish them when they came, but they&#x2019;d grown increasingly rare. Most of the time&#x2013;this afternoon, for example&#x2013;he found he would rather not look at her at all because she would only look ruined: heavy, dissatisfied, apparently grieving in silence for the loss of herself.<br><br>A kindly, aging army doctor at Fort Meade, in discussing her condition, had once made use of the word &#x201c;neurasthenia&#x201d;&#x2013;and Charles, after looking it up in the dictionary, had decided it was something he could live with. But later, in New York, a much younger civilian doctor had dismissed that term as being too old-fashioned and imprecise to have any value in modern medicine. Then, like an overconfident salesman, this younger man had begun to press for what he called &#x201c;a course of psychotherapy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if we&#x2019;re going to argue about words, Doctor,&#x201d; Charles said, barely keeping his temper, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to tell you that I have no confidence in any word beginning with &#x2018;psych.&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t think you people know what you&#x2019;re doing in that funny, shifty field, and I don&#x2019;t think you ever will.&#x201d;<br><br>And he&#x2019;d never been sorry he&#x2019;d said that, or that he&#x2019;d gotten up and walked out of the office a minute later, even though it gave the doctor permission to sit there looking as piqued and vain, as dirty-minded and victorious as a portrait photograph of Sigmund Freud himself. Some things you did were worth regretting; others not.<br><br>Not very long ago, during the worst of his son&#x2019;s difficulties, Charles had found himself unable to prevent the insidious current of psychiatric jargon from beginning to flow again, here in his own house, as various people urged him to &#x201c;get professional help&#x201d; for Evan, or to &#x201c;look into professional counseling&#x201d; for him; and the funny part now was that he could remember being halfway tempted to go along with that kind of talk, if only because all other talk at the time had been so much more unsettling&#x2013;talk of police probation and of juvenile court, even talk of reform school. Those were days when it often seemed there would always be a stranger&#x2019;s angry voice on the phone, complaining about Evan, or a couple of cops at the door.<br><br>Well, it certainly was remarkable how a boy could change. And maybe things like this really did get better of their own accord, if you gave them time; maybe all you could ever do, beyond suffering, was wait and see what might be going to happen next.<br><br>From this sun porch, by leaning a little forward in his chair and looking out through an unshaded section of one window, even a man with weak vision could see the outlines of Evan Shepard concluding his day&#x2019;s work in the driveway&#x2013;putting tools away, tiredly straightening his spine, wiping his hands on a clean rag.<br><br>&#x201c;And you know what else is really surprising, dear?&#x201d; Charles said. &#x201c;About Evan?&#x201d; He <i>looks</i> so much better. In the face, I mean. I don&#x2019;t think we could ever have expected it, but he&#x2019;s turning into a very&#x2013;an extremely good-looking young man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I know,&#x201d; Grace Shepard said, using her voice for the first time all day, and smiling for the first time too. &#x201c;Oh, yes, I know. He certainly is.&#x201d;<br><br>And they could both sense that they weren&#x2019;t the only observers to have noticed that.</p><h2>The Delicate Storm</h2><p>In the wake of a dual murder during a freak winter warm spell, Algonquin Bay homicide detectives Delorme and Cardinal link the killings to other unsolved murders spanning back some thirty years, a case with possible connections to Quebec terrorist activities.

And when an Algonquin Bay resident is found murdered in the same woods, Cardinal realizes that there may be more to this case than he first believed. <br> <br>With his authority on the investigation constantly challenged, Cardinal finds that he must band together with a former nemesis, Corporal Malcolm Musgrave of the RCMP, to outwit a common enemy.

Against orders, and risking life and career, Cardinal digs deeper into the seemingly small-town murder. And when he does, he uncovers a series of lies and conspiracies that go back nearly thirty years and extend to the highest reaches of Canadian intelligence. <br> <br> <b>Excerpt from <i>The Delicate Storm</i>:</b> <br> <i>Cardinal sat on the edge of the bed, depressed at his lack of direction. Half the time -- at least in a place the size of Algonquin Bay -- it was the killer himself who called cops to the scene of the crime. Now, here was a genuine mystery and Cardinal didn?t have a single lead to point him away from the improbable story about ice fishing. An American citizen had come up to his town and -- if he hadn?t been followed -- had managed in a very short time to upset somebody enough to get himself murdered. And whoever it was didn?t just kill him, but attempted to wipe out all trace of his identity. Why?</i></p><h2>Dream Street: W. Eugene Smith&#39;s Pittsburgh Project</h2><p>Legendary photographer W. Eugene Smith&#39;s epic study of Pittsburgh in the 1950s. In 1955, having just ended his high-profile but stormy career with Life magazine by resigning, W. Eugene Smith was commissioned to spend three weeks in Pittsburgh and produce one hundred photographs for noted journalist and author Stefan Lorant&#39;s book commemorating the city&#39;s bicentennial. Smith stayed a year, compiling nearly sixteen thousand photographs for what would be the most ambitious photographic essay of his life. But only a fragment of the work was ever seen, despite Smith&#39;s lifelong conviction that it was his greatest set of photographs. Now, in an astonishing, first-time assemblage, edited by Sam Stephenson, of the group of core pictures that Smith asserted were the &#34;synthesis of the whole,&#34; we see a portrayal not just of Pittsburgh but also of America at mid-century by a master photojournalist. In his accompanying essay, Alan Trachtenberg provides a critical reading of Smith&#39;s photographs, assessing Smith&#39;s attempt to document visually an American city in the context of the time period. 175 duotone photographs.</p><p><b>Sam Stephenson</b> is a writer and research consultant at the Center for Documentary Studies. <b>Alan Trachtenberg</b> is Neil Grey Professor of American Studies and English Literature at Yale University.In 1955, the historian Stefan Lorant hired W. Eugene Smith to make a hundred photographs of contemporary Pittsburgh for a book in celebration of the city's bicentennial; he expected the job to take no more than three weeks. But Smith, whose grand ambitions and uncompromising aesthetic had recently led him to resign his stormy tenure at Life, quickly became obsessed, shooting some seventeen thousand pictures. Inspired by Joyce and Faulkner, Smith envisioned a symphonic, multilayered photo essay portraying the entire city; his failure to complete it haunted him for the rest of his life. Here are more than a hundred and fifty of his noirish and oddly poignant images: gleaming railyards at night; buildings wrapped in clouds of industrial smoke; the face of a steelworker, the Bessemer fires reflected in his safety goggles. <br> Copyright � 2005 <i>The New Yorker</i></p><h2>Rebel Without a Crew: Or How a 23-Year-Old Filmmaker with $7,000 Became a Hollywood Player</h2><p>A behind-the-scenes look at the film world by the 23-year-old director of El Mariachi, a highly successful low-budget independent film, covers the making of that film and the business deals that made its success possible. 15,000 first printing.

This development confirmed a long-standing suspicion: that the world endured a 500-year cold snap-The Little Ice Age-that lasted roughly from A.D. 1300 until 1850. The Little Ice Age tells the story of the turbulent, unpredictable and often very cold years of modern European history, how climate altered historical events, and what they mean in the context of today&#39;s global warming. With its basis in cutting-edge science, The Little Ice Age offers a new perspective on familiar events. Renowned archaeologist Brian Fagan shows how the increasing cold affected Norse exploration; how changing sea temperatures caused English and Basque fishermen to follow vast shoals of cod all the way to the New World; how a generations-long subsistence crisis in France contributed to social disintegration and ultimately revolution; and how English efforts to improve farm productivity in the face of a deteriorating climate helped pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and hence for global warming. This is a fascinating, original book for anyone interested in history, climate, or the new subject of how they interact.</p><p>"Climate change is the ignored player on the historical stage," writes archeologist Brian Fagan. But it shouldn't be, not if we know what's good for us. We can't judge what future climate change will mean unless we know something about its effects in the past: "those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it." And Fagan's story of the last thousand years, centered on the "Little Ice Age," reminds us of what we could end up repeating: flood, fire, and famine--acts of God exacerbated by acts of man.<p> For all that he takes a broad--a <i>very</i> broad--view of European history, Fagan's writing is laced with human faces, fascinating anecdotes, and a gift for the telling detail that makes history live, very much in the style of Barbara Tuchman's <i>A Distant Mirror</i>. When Fagan talks about the voyages of Basque fishermen to American shores (probably landing before Columbus sailed), he puts in the taste of dried cod and the terrifying suddenness of fogs on the Grand Banks. The Great Fire of London, what it was like when the Dutch dikes broke, the Irish Potato Famine, the year without a summer, ice fairs on the Thames, and volcanoes in the South Pacific--Fagan makes history a ripping yarn in which we are all actors, on a stage that has always been changing. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>Brian Fagan is America&#39;s leading writer on archaeology. A Professor of Archaeology at the University of California at Santa Barbara, he is the author of Floods, Famines, and Emperors, The Great Journey, and many other popular works, and the editor of The Oxford Companion to Archaeology. He lives in Santa Barbara, California.</p><h2>The Artist in His Studio</h2><p>Liberman draws on his skill as a photographer and his wide acquaintance with the great modern artists to construct a splendid visual and verbal meditation on art and the act of creation. First serial to Vogue and Vanity Fair. 216 photos, 161 in full color.</p><p>Displaying an artist's sensitivity, an editor's skill, and a camera's perceptive eye, Liberman's 1960 classic, The Artist in His Studio , presented a singular image of the great artists working in France during the 20th century. Twenty-eight years later, he offers a revised and expanded edition, strengthening his contribution to the world of art by adding material to some sections and enlarging the number of artists. Liberman's empathy and erudition, enhanced by fine reproduction quality, is exemplified by his intimate conversations with many of the artists, sensitive shots of the surroundings in which they created, and keen understanding of the creative process. Matisse's hand, a pensive Giacometti, the meticulous line of tools laid out by Braqueall are photographic witness to an intimacy pierced by the author's vision.

Most folks would call Kim Sartain an easygoing, peace-loving man. But the few who crossed the young drifter knew there was nothing he liked better than a good fight. When cattleman Jim Targ challenges Sartain&#39;s right to ride across an unclaimed stretch of meadow, Sartain decides he&#39;ll do better than ride through: He&#39;ll put down stakes there and homestead the land. Soon there&#39;s more at risk than land and pride when Targ hires a gunman to teach Sartain a permanent--and deadly--lesson.</p><p><p>Louis L'Amour's 115 title-plus bibliography is astonishing on its own; even more so given the fact that his writing career did not start in earnest until his 40s. Simply being prolific, however, does not a bestselling author make. L'Amour's Western stories, as written by a real-life adventurer, capture the survivalism and code of honor on which the American frontier mythology rests.</p> <p>Our foremost storyteller of the authentic West, Louis L'Amour has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and women who settled the American frontier. There are more than 260 million copies of his books in print around the world.</p>Here&#39;s another entry in this justifiably popular series. Like the previous entries, Grub Line Rider features believable background sounds and appropriate musical punctuation. The cast was apparently chosen by an expert, with professional actors perfectly selected for believable vocal characterizations. The story itself is a routine tale of a tough and fearless young man confronting tough and fearless bad guys who want to take over unused grazing land from a rancher who happens to have a pretty daughter. Here we have a story that sounds better than it reads, and the overall effect is like the finest of old-time radio. D.W.

She has been sewing since the age of 12, about the time she took her first home economics class. Her parents were classically trained, professional musicians. As the oldest of three sisters she was expected to take piano lessons; and later on, learned to play the cello. Her parents impressed upon her the importance of finding a passion; which Ann did. It wasn't music, it was all the fiber arts, and the most important was sewing. Neither parent sewed, so they did their best to find classes and women in the church that could help Ann with her sewing projects. Like most teenage girls, she became very interested in clothing and fashion. To her, sewing was a very enjoyable pastime, and she was good at it. So from that time on, she made her own clothing. By the time she reached the University of Wisconsin, she was sure that sewing and clothing would lead her to a career in business and retailing. She went on to work for Gimbels, Marshall Field &amp; Co., and two different chains of fabric stores. In 1978, she took the beginning quilting class that changed her life forever. In her earlier years, quilts never interested Ann, even though she grew up with old quilts on the beds at her grandmothers' homes. From the first night of the quilting class, she realized that this new media allowed her to put all of her loves together: sewing, color, texture, shape, thread and fabric. She could experiment and sew as she developed her own designs and ideas instead of traditional blocks. A new world and career began for her! Ann has been teaching since 1981, the year of her first blue ribbon winning quilt. Now she travels across the US working with guilds, symposiums, retreats and quilters of all ages and experience. Connecting with quilters is an energizing and enjoyable part of her quilting career. Her work has been exhibited in competitions, solo exhibits and invitational shows across the United States, France and Japan. Her work is included in the collections of Northwestern Mutual Insurance Co., Neiman Marcus, Quilts, Inc., Ripon College, Winona Lake Restoration and many private collections. She enjoys the challenge of quilt competitions, so she continues to design new work keeping the level of workmanship high. She has authored 2 books, Coloring with Thread and Dancing with Thread have been published by C&amp;T Publishing Inc. In Coloring, she details how she creates her subjects with free-motion embroidery. It is also available in the Russian language. Dancing is about her free-spirited approach to machine quilting. She finds the work very creative and shares this with her readers. Ann also has an instructional DVD titled Coloring with Thread. It shows step-by-step how she creates her beautiful embroidery, gives a tour of her studio, and a peek at some of her new quilts. Another first for Ann, is a booklet titled Creating Beautiful Bias Binding, now available on her website. Binding the edge of a quilt or wallhanging is a challenge for new sewers and quilters. It gives complete instructions on all phases of binding; from quilt preparation to hand sewing the folded edge on the back. Ann also has a blog where she writes about many issues of interest to quilters: annfahl.blogspot.com A Black and White Tale is the title of Ann's traveling exhibit. Each of the 20 quilts tells a little story about the life of her cat Oreo. This is a humorous collection of colorful quilts, showcasing Ann's machine embroidery and quilting. The exhibit is available to guilds and organizations; and was featured on her episode of TheQuiltShow.com, beginning Oct 15, 2007. Ann is married, lives with her husband and cat. Her 2 sons are grown and have helped to design her website at www.annfahl.com.</p><h2>The Forbidden Library</h2><p><b><i>The Forbidden Library</i> kicks off an action-packed &nbsp;fantasy series with classic appeal, a resourceful heroine, a host of magical creatures, and no shortage of narrow escapes--perfect for fans of <i>Story Thieves</i>,&nbsp;<i>Coraline</i>, <i>Inkheart</i>, and Harry Potter</b><br><br><i>Alice always thought fairy tales had happy endings.

She wouldn&#x2019;t be bothering anyone, either. Her room had its own little writing desk and even its own electric lamp, which her father had had installed three years before with the boast that no daughter of <i>his</i> was going to ruin her eyes scribbling by gaslight.</p><p>Her father had been working late again. When Alice heard the telltale creak of the front door, she weighed the odds and decided he&#x2019;d probably be happier to see her than angry that she was still up. She shrugged into her robe and padded into the hall and down the stairs.</p><p>The late-night silence was a little unnerving. Alice had grown up in a house that had practically bustled with servants and guests, even in the middle of the night, and she was used to seeing strangers about. But the servants had departed one by one as times had grown mean, until only Cook, Miss Juniper, and her father&#x2019;s man were left, and the visitors were less common than they used to be. The guest rooms that lined the hallway were all shut up now, with sheets draped over the furniture.</p><p>She passed the doors quickly, tugging her robe a little tighter, and ducked into the servants&#x2019; stairs that led to the kitchen. Her father would probably be there, fixing himself something hot to drink.</p><p>Sure enough, the swinging door at the bottom of the steps was outlined in yellow light. Alice put her hand out to push it open, but as her fingers brushed the wood she heard the voices, and realized her father wasn&#x2019;t alone.</p><p>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you have to know what we can do for you, Mr. Creighton,&#x201d; said someone who wasn&#x2019;t her father. &#x201c;Someone is going to take advantage of it sooner or later.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice turned away at once. Being up late was one thing, but eavesdropping on her father&#x2019;s business conversations was quite another. She&#x2019;d put her foot on the first step when the sound of her father&#x2019;s voice brought her up short.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you <i>dare</i> threaten my family.&#x201d;</p><p>The words hung in the air for long seconds, like a fading firework.</p><p>Her father never shouted, at least not in her hearing. He was a quiet, honest man who dealt fairly with everyone, put flowers on her mother&#x2019;s grave once a month, and went to church every Sunday. Hearing him talk like that was like watching a teddy bear yawn and reveal a mouth full of fangs. Alice stood perfectly still, not daring to move even her eyes. She wanted to run, knew she <i>ought</i> to&#x2014;whatever was being said was obviously not for her ears&#x2014;but her feet felt like lead weights.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Creighton,&#x201d; said the other man. &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s <i>threatening</i>. I&#x2019;m just stating a fact. Nothing wrong with stating a fact, is there? No law against it.&#x201d;</p><p>His voice was odd, high and nasal. Alice could hear a strange sound as well, a kind of urgent <i>thrum-thrum-thrum</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mess me around,&#x201d; her father said, not shouting now but still angrier than she&#x2019;d ever heard him. &#x201c;We both know what you&#x2019;re here to say, and I&#x2019;m sure you know what my answer&#x2019;s going to be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I strongly recommend you reconsider your position, Mr. Creighton.&#x201d; The thrumming grew louder. &#x201c;For the sake of everyone involved.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By God,&#x201d; Alice&#x2019;s father said. &#x201c;So help me, I ought to break your ugly head against the wall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could do that,&#x201d; the other man said. &#x201c;You could do that, Mr. Creighton. But you won&#x2019;t. You know it would be unwise.&#x201d; His voice dropped a fraction. &#x201c;For the girl, most of all.&#x201d;</p><p>Slowly, ever so slowly, Alice turned around. Her heart was still beating so hard, it seemed a wonder that her father couldn&#x2019;t hear it. She stepped back down to the door, carefully avoiding the creaky step, and pressed her fingers into the crack of light. It was wrong, possibly the most wrong thing she had ever done in her entire <i>life,</i> but she had to see. She gave the swinging door the lightest touch, and the crack widened into a gap big enough for a garter snake, to which she applied her eye.</p><p>The light made her squint. On one side of the room was her father, still in his suit, looking rumpled. His hair was damp with sweat. One of his hands was curled around the handle of a cast-iron frying pan sitting on the range, as though he meant to swing it and make good on his threat.</p><p>Across from him, hanging in the air, was a fairy.</p><p>When Alice had been a little girl, her father had given her a book called <i>The Enchanted Forest</i>. It was a big book made with thick paper, and had large type with pen-and-ink illustrations on each facing page. She&#x2019;d probably been a bit too old for it, truth be told, but she&#x2019;d read it anyway, as she read every piece of printed material that fell within her reach. It was the story of a rather stupid little girl who wandered into an enchanted forest, and caused a good deal of havoc among the creatures who lived there.</p><p>One of those creatures had been a fairy. It was a slim, child-like figure with wide eyes and a button nose wearing flowing robes, held aloft by gauzy insect wings&#x2014;Alice had always imagined the wings in translucent greens and blues, like a butterfly&#x2019;s&#x2014;and it had looked down at the little girl with an air of amused benevolence while it stood daintily in her raised palm.</p><p>At that age, Alice had grasped the idea that some things in books were real, and others were not. Questioning her father had revealed that there were such things as lions, tigers, and elephants (he&#x2019;d promised a visit to the zoo, which had yet to happen), while trolls, centaurs, and dragons were the figments of writers&#x2019; overactive imaginations. Alice remembered feeling vaguely annoyed at the author of <i>The Enchanted Forest,</i> who had clearly intended to deceive little girls possessing less penetrating intellects than her own.</p><p>There was, her father had told her, no such thing as fairies, either.</p><p>The thing hovering in the air in Alice&#x2019;s kitchen was similar enough to the picture in the book to be instantly recognizable, but he was larger, for one thing. The creature in the book had been insectile, six inches high at most, while this creature was a good two feet from head to heel. His wings were enormous, considerably bigger than his slender body, and beat the air so fast, they were a blur, like a hummingbird&#x2019;s. They were colored, not in greens and blues, but yellow and black, which put Alice in mind of something nasty and poisonous.</p><p>The fairy&#x2019;s skin was off-white and gnarled with warty growths sprouting clusters of thick, black hair. His scalp was bare and bald as an egg, gleaming wetly in the electric light. He had no nose at all, and his eyes were wide but black from edge to edge. When he spoke, she could see a mouth full of needle-like teeth, and a long red tongue like a snake&#x2019;s.</p><p>Alice closed her eyes. <i>This</i>, she thought, <i>is ridiculous</i>. <i>There are no such things as fairies.</i> She gave herself a pinch on the arm, which hurt, and counted slowly to ten.</p><p><i>When I open my eyes, </i>she thought, <i>he will be gone</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;I really wish you&#x2019;d at least hear my offer,&#x201d; said the nasal voice.</p><p>Alice opened her eyes. The fairy was still there. He had hovered closer to her father, his wings <i>thrum-thrumming,</i> one tiny finger wagging in under his nose.</p><p>&#x201c;I will not,&#x201d; Alice&#x2019;s father said. &#x201c;I will not entertain any sort of <i>offer</i>. Go back and tell your master that. And tell him, if he troubles me again, I&#x2019;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>The fairy waited, lip curled in a cocky grin that showed his teeth. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll what, Mr. Creighton?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get out!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Get out of my house!&#x201d;</p><p>There was a long moment of silence. The fairy hovered, impudently, as if to demonstrate that he didn&#x2019;t <i>have</i> to go just because her father had said so. Then, with an affected sigh, he spun in the air and zipped out the open doorway on the other side of the room. Alice heard one of the front windows rattle open.</p><p>Her father sagged, like a heavy weight had been fastened around his shoulders. He let go of the frying pan and leaned on the range for support. Alice wanted to run to him, but she didn&#x2019;t dare. Whatever she had just seen&#x2014;and she was still not certain <i>what</i> she had just seen&#x2014;it was something she had not been supposed to witness.</p><p>Alice&#x2019;s father took a long breath, closed his eyes, and blew it out slowly, tickling the edges of his mustache. Then his eyes snapped open, full of panic.</p><p>&#x201c;Alice,&#x201d; he said, under his breath. &#x201c;Oh God.&#x201d;</p><p>All of a sudden he was running, struggling to get his feet under him, caroming off the kitchen doorway and out toward the main stairs. Alice was caught for a moment in stunned surprise, then started running herself, back up the servants&#x2019; stairs, heedless of the creaking. He made it to her door only a few seconds before she arrived.</p><p>Finding the door ajar, he flung it open, and stared wide-eyed at the empty room. His expression, bathed in the glow of her electric desk lamp, was the most terrifying thing Alice had ever seen.</p><p>She hurried to his side and grabbed his arm. &#x201c;Father! Is something wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2014;&#x201d; He gestured weakly at her empty room, then down at her. &#x201c;I thought&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was studying,&#x201d; Alice said, &#x201c;and I got up for a moment. I&#x2019;m sorry if I startled you.&#x201d;</p><p>All at once his fierceness melted, and he wrapped his arms around her in a hug so tight, he lifted her off the ground.</p><p>&#x201c;Alice,&#x201d; he said, his scratchy cheek pressed against her forehead. &#x201c;Alice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here, Father.&#x201d; She squirmed until she worked her own arms free, then put them around him as far as they would go.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; he said. She wasn&#x2019;t sure if he was talking to himself or not. &#x201c;Everything is going to be all right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course it is,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>When he let go, there was something new in his face, a strange, wild determination so far out of the ordinary that it made Alice feel scared and proud of him, both at once. He set her down gently, put his hands on her shoulders, and looked her in the eye.</p><p>&#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You know that, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Alice felt herself blushing. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes were already miles away. He patted her shoulder, absently, and then hurried toward his study. Alice looked after him, wondering about the decision she&#x2019;d seen in his eyes.</p><p>Then, because she was a girl who followed the rules, she went back into her room and went to bed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next morning, everything seemed so normal that Alice almost thought she&#x2019;d dreamed the whole thing. Almost, but not quite.</p><p>She woke up in her familiar bed, under her warm, familiar quilt with its frayed edge. Her room was just her familiar room, with the heavy oak wardrobe in one corner and the framed picture of her grandmother looking down benevolently.</p><p>There was no elf sitting on her desk, and her books were just where she&#x2019;d left them the night before. No troll in the heavy wooden chest at the foot of the bed, only the winter comforters and an ancient pair of stuffed rabbits she couldn&#x2019;t quite bear to throw away. She even, feeling intensely self-conscious, lifted the bedskirts and looked underneath, but there was no dragon there, only a thick layer of dust.</p><p>Nevertheless, she was certain what she&#x2019;d seen had been real. The memory was bright and clear, not fuzzy and fading the way dreams were. When she sat down for breakfast with her father, she became doubly sure. He was acting normal, but it <i>was</i> an act, a little too sincere to believe.</p><p>&#x201c;Earthquakes again,&#x201d; he said, paging through the <i>Times</i>. &#x201c;First New Zealand, now Managua. Thousands dead, it says.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s terrible,&#x201d; Alice said, because she knew it was expected of her. She was trying to keep from staring at her father&#x2019;s face. He&#x2019;d washed and shaved since last night, of course, but there was still something tight around his eyes. <i>It wasn&#x2019;t a dream,</i> she thought. <i>I&#x2019;m sure of it.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Something ought to be done about it,&#x201d; he said, turning the page. &#x201c;And still fighting in Spain. Seems like the whole world&#x2019;s coming to pieces.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You always say they only print the bad news,&#x201d; Alice said.</p><p>Her father looked up and smiled, but it didn&#x2019;t reach his eyes.</p><p>Cooper, her father&#x2019;s man, appeared with a plate of toast and jam. Properly speaking, it wasn&#x2019;t his job to serve at table, but Alice&#x2019;s father had been forced to give the last of the footmen the sack when they&#x2019;d caught him stealing from the pantry. Cooper insisted he didn&#x2019;t mind. In this day and age, he said, a man ought to be grateful to have work at all.</p><p>Her father put the paper aside and went to work on the toast, all in silence. Alice took a slice herself and carefully covered it with jam, right to the edges, working carefully with the butter knife to spread it evenly. The longer neither of them spoke, the more the silence grew and grew, like some monstrous thing squatting on the table between them. When her father finally cleared his throat Alice gave a little start.</p><p>&#x201c;Alice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Father?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going on a trip.&#x201d; He paused, and took a deep breath. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s come up. It&#x2019;s important, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When?&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;And how long will you be gone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m catching a steamer tonight.&#x201d;</p><p><i>A ship?</i> Her father&#x2019;s business took him all over New England, and occasionally as far as Chicago or Washington, D.C., but he&#x2019;d never been gone for more than a week, and never on a steamer. &#x201c;And where&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; He folded the paper and pushed it over to her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the <i>Gideon,</i> bound for Buenos Aires.&#x201d; The schedule, a set of stops all down through the Caribbean and South America, was printed in a neat box beside the ticket prices and number for inquiries. &#x201c;This way you&#x2019;ll be able to keep track of me.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice put one hand on the paper and swallowed hard, trying to sound as normal as she could. &#x201c;When should I expect you back?&#x201d;</p><p>His expression cracked. Just for a moment, but Alice was watching him closely, and she knew him better than anyone. His mouth turned down, pulling at his mustache, and his eyes glittered with tears.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be some time,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Alice. I wish there was another way.&#x201d;</p><p>Something was wrong, very wrong. Alice fought a growing thickness in her throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps I should come with you,&#x201d; she said. Ordinarily she wouldn&#x2019;t have dreamed of offering such a suggestion unbidden, but desperate times called for desperate measures. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve always said I need more experience in the practical side of business&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, a little too quickly. &#x201c;Not this trip. When I get back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He forced a smile. &#x201c;Maybe then it&#x2019;ll be time for you to start making the rounds with me. But I&#x2019;ll make sure to send you a postcard from every stop.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Color Image Scale</h2><p>Using and combining colors is now easy with the revolutionary new <em>Color Image Scale</em> developed by Japan's leading color psychologist, Shigenobu Kobayashi, the author of the best-selling <em>A Book of Colors</em>. <br><br>After three years of intensive research, Kobayashi and his team at the Nippon Color &amp; Design Research Institute have matched 130 basic colors and over 1,000 color combinations to 180 key image words, allowing you the expression of any mood, lifestyle, or taste through the creative use of color combinations. <br><br>If you want to make an interior or an outfit "elegant", "romantic", or even "provocative", just look up -the word in the key image word index, and choose any one of the dozens of color combinations listed under the entry.

What starts as a simple journey becomes a dangerous and complicated set of battles and decisions. Humans, monsters, unearthly creatures . . . who among these can Rossam�nd trust? D. M. Cornish has created an entirely original world, grounded in his own deft, classically influenced illustrations. Foundling is a magic-laced, Dickensian adventure that will transport the reader.</p><p>D.M. Cornish was born in time to see the first Star Wars movie. He was five. It made him realize that worlds beyond his own were possible, and he failed to eat his popcorn. Experiences with C.S. Lewis, and later J.R.R. Tolkien, completely convinced him that other worlds existed, and that writers had a key to these worlds. But words were not yet his earliest tools for storytelling. Drawings were.<p>He spent most of his childhood drawing, as well as most of his teenage and adult years as well. And by age eleven he had made his first book, called "Attack from Mars." It featured Jupitans and lots and lots of drawings of space battles. (It has never been published and world rights are still available.)</p><p>He studied illustration at the University of South Australia, where he began to compile a series of notebooks, beginning with #1 in 1993. He had read Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast novels, The Iliad, and Paul Gallico's Love of Seven Dolls. Classical ideas as well as the great desire to continue what Mervyn Peake had begun but not finished led him to delineate his own world. Hermann Hesse, Kafka and other writers convinced him there were ways to be fantastical without conforming to the generally accepted notions of fantasy. Over the next ten years he filled 23 journals with his pictures, definitions, ideas and histories of his world, the Half-Continent.</p><p>It was not until 2003 that a chance encounter with a children's publisher gave him an opportunity to develop these ideas further. Learning of his journals, she bullied him into writing a story from his world. Cornish was sent away with the task of delivering 1,000 words the following week and each week thereafter. Abandoning all other paid work, he spent the next two years propped up with one small advance after the other as his publisher tried desperately to keep him from eating his furniture. </p><p>And so Rossamund's story was born - a labor of love over twelve years in the making.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Trembling, and ignoring the dead bogles, Rossam�nd crept closer to the fallen fulgar. His heart teetered on the brink of complete terror at the thought of being left alone in this malignant place. As he neared her, he bent lower and ever lower, trying to see her face, trying to gain some hopeful hint of her condition. She lay twisted, limbs carelessly poking every which way, long hair a wispy mess obscuring her whole head. Holding back for just a moment, he knelt beside her and gingerly poked some of her chestnut locks away from her throat, cheek and brow. She was deathly pale. <p> Grinnling cries in the distance. </p><p> Rossam�nd scurried to the landaulet, took the lantern and dashed back to where the fulgar lay. He knelt and looked to see if she was still alive, wanting to weep but holding it in- he had cried enough on this journey. Blood was running from Europe's nose. There were nasty bites upon her neck where the proofing did not cover. Breaths did come: short, shallow puffing. She lived! </p><p> Rossam�nd leaned closer and whispered, "Miss . . . ! Miss . . . Miss Europe . . . !"</p><p> The fulgar's lashes fluttered and slowly parted, her vision clearly swimming. They shut again and it seemed she might slip into insensibility. Rossam�nd pressed twice, sharply, on her shoulder, not wanting her to pass out. She groaned and shifted, opening her eyes again to peer at him. </p><p> With a gasp, Europe pushed herself up on her arms and sat, head lolling, hair drooping. "What happened?" she panted.</p><p> Rossam�nd sat back. "You won . . . you beat them all."</p><p> She looked about, blinking heavily. Her eyes were streaming with ash-colored tears. </p><p> Rossam�nd winced. He had hit her with the bothersalts too.</p><p> After a long pause and a deep sigh, she whispered, "Good . . . They were . . . difficult." Sitting up straighter, she flexed her shoulders and rolled her head about, grunting and grimacing. "My organs have spasmed," she breathed cryptically. "Not the best time for it, at all . . . I thought I was done for." Pausing for a rattling wheeze of air, she muttered, "Never advisable to . . . start a fight . . . when one is missing a . . . a dose of treacle."</p></p><h2>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek (Picador Books)</h2><p>Through a year of on-foot explorations through her own landscape, Annie Dillard shares her keen observations, poetic sensibilities, introspective reflections, and reverence for her surroundings to show us the world outside as we have never seen it before, in this winner of the 1975 Pulitizer Prize for nonfiction..</p><p><p>Limited Edition</p><p>&#x201c;I had been my whole life a bell, and never knew it until at that moment I was lifted and struck.&#x201d;</p><p> Annie Dillard has written eleven books, including the memoir of her parents, <i>An American Childhood</i>; the Northwest pioneer epic <i>The Living</i>; and the nonfiction narrative <i>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</i>.

Have you been to the doctor, only to leave with a prescription for antibiotics, few answers, and little to no hope? Hidradenitis supprativa (HS) is a poorly understood skin condition that is believed to affect nearly twelve million people in the United States alone. Only a small fraction of those affected have been properly diagnosed, leaving many others to suffer in silence or pursue ill-advised conventional treatment methods that fail to address the cause of this painful condition. Tara Grant, a twenty-year sufferer of HS, has become an underground legend to her Internet community of HS victims by presenting a methodical, self-tested action plan to heal naturally. The centerpiece of her holistic approach rests on the understanding that HS is an autoimmune disorder caused by leaky gut syndrome. With a few simple dietary changes that eliminate certain trigger' foods, you can heal your gut, restore your skin, reclaim your health, and rid yourself of HS symptoms forever. That means no antibiotics, no experimental surgeries, and no more pain, suffering, or confusion.</p></p><p><p>Tara Grant is a featured success story on MarksDailyApple.com (Tons of Doctors and No Solution) and in the Primal Blueprint 21-Day Total Body Transformation.

Containing atmospheric artwork, this edition aims to bring Dickensian London and its inhabitants to life.</p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Tunnels</h2><p>Used.

Maria Baez Kijac goes a long way in remedying that problem for us with the publication of The South American Table. This glorious work is a literal love note to the beauties and pleasures of the foods of South America. The pages within are absolutely packed with history, geography, anecdotes, and, of course, tremendous recipes. Each preparation is introduced with pertinent cooking information or an insightful story that makes the actual preparation of the dish just that much more special. </p><p>In my own cuisine, I covet ideas from around the world, and I can enthusiastically say that I have thoroughly mined these pages and discovered many gems. The Sopa de Quinua con Chancho (Quinoa Soup with Pork), for example, is a preparation that is simultaneously exotic and earthy, with the elegant flavors of cumin and annatto subtly perfuming the dish. Also, the Calabi Matutero (Chicken with Okra and Cabbage), which was originally made with goat, is extremely light and delicate, yet it has tremendous depth of flavor. Additionally, I'm quite fond of the Librillo en Salsa Mani (Tripe in Peanut Sauce). This unique preparation, with its satiny peanut essence, will forever change the way you think about tripe. And for sheer sensual delight, go straight for the Cuscuz de Tapioca (Tapioca and Coconut Cake). You will be sneaking bites of this when no one is looking. </p><p>Best of all, this book contains exclusively recipes that are straightforward and unintimidating, approachable for any level of experience in the kitchen. Plus, you will discover, as I have, that the foods of South America are quite healthy, relying on fresh seasonal produce and deemphasizing the use of cream and butter. Furthermore, if The South American Table whets your appetite to learn more, then you can refer to the stunningly extensive bibliography in the rear of the book. </p><p>One's appreciation for the utter depth of information contained here will grow with each visit into these pages. We all owe Maria Baez Kijac a hearty salutation of "Three cheers!" for her prodigious accomplishment, for with The South American Table, she has delivered a masterpiece. </p><p>Charlie Trotter</p>No Bio</p><h2>The Art of Star Wars, Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back</h2><p>THE ART OF STAR WARS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a magnificent, full-color celebration of the amazing artistic and technical accomplishments in the second chapter of the most spectacular space epic of all time.

Yet Smith saw himself primarily as a philosopher rather than an economist and would never have predicted that the ideas for which he is now best known were his most important. This&nbsp;biography shows the extent to which Smith's great works,&nbsp;<i>The Wealth of Nations </i>and <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments,</i> were part of one of the most ambitious projects of the Euruopean Enlightenment, a grand &#x201c;Science of Man" that would encompass law, history, and aesthetics as well as economics and ethics, and which was only half complete on Smith&#x2019;s death in 1790.</p><p>Nick Phillipson reconstructs Smith&#x2019;s intellectual ancestry and shows what Smith took from, and what he gave to, in the rapidly changing intellectual and commercial cultures of Glasgow and Edinburgh as they entered the great years of the Scottish Enlightenment. Above all he explains how far Smith&#x2019;s ideas developed in dialogue with those of his closest friend, the other titan of the age, David Hume.</p></p><p><b>Nicholas Phillipson</b> is one of the leading scholars of the Scottish Enlightenment.

His latest misadventure begins when he's caught dumping trash in a public field. Faced with a $500 fine, he grudgingly agrees to let the town use his property for its Harvest Festival. Soon the antisocial grouch is overrun with polka bands, hog callers, and an intolerable spirit of fun. He jumps into his '59 Edsel and heads for the Florida swamps, where he meets his match in a misanthrope who turns out to be his long-lost brother. The worst returns home feeling strangely more sociable and even sends a painted coconut to the festival craft show.

Supt. Roy Grace. Michael Harrison, a successful real estate developer with a penchant for practical jokes, gets a horrible taste of his own medicine. As a prank, four of his friends bury Michael alive in a coffin equipped with a breathing tube and a bottle of whiskey and leave him, ostensibly for a couple of hours. But when their van crashes head-on into a truck and three of them are killed (the fourth dies later "in hospital"), Michael is trapped. His cell phone doesn't work, but he does have a two-way radio whose companion is in the hands of Davey, a mentally challenged young man who finds the phone near the scene of the accident. Grace, a detective with a taste for the supernatural (he uses mediums to help him solve crimes), gets on the case and discovers just how devious Michael's friends have been. The "buried alive" trope is undeniably powerful, and Grace shows promise as a hero&#x2014;but the crime and the plot surrounding Michael's plight are just too cumbersome and transparent to really engage the reader. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

All was bustle and confusion; and for a few minutes Miss Malvern, climbing down from the coach, was bewildered by it, and stood looking round her rather helplessly. Until the guard dumped at her feet the small corded trunk which contained her worldly possessions and advised her to look sharp to it, no one paid the least attention to her, except an ostler leading out two horses, and adjuring her to get out of the way, and one of the inevitable street-vendors who haunted busy inn-yards, begging her to buy some gingerbread. The guard, assailed by demands from several anxious travellers to have their bags and bandboxes restored to them immediately, had little time to spare, but Miss Malvern's flower-like countenance, and her air of youthful innocence, impelled him to ask her if anyone was meeting her. When she shook her head, he clicked his tongue disapprovingly, and expressed a hope that she might at least know where she was a-going to.</p> <p>A gleam of amusement lightened the shadows in Miss Malvern's large gray eyes; she replied, with a tiny chuckle: 'Oh, yes! I do know that!'<br> 'What you want, missy, is a hack!' said the guard.<br> 'No, I don't: I want a porter!' said Miss Malvern, speaking with unexpected decision.</p> <p>The guard seemed to be inclined to argue this point, but as a stout lady was tugging at his coat-tails, shrilly demanding to know what he had done with a basket of fish consigned to<br> his care, he was obliged to abandon Miss Malvern to her fate, merely shouting in stentorian accents for a porter to carry the young lady's trunk.</p> <p>This summons was responded to by a burly individual in a frieze coat, who undertook, for the sum of sixpence, to carry Miss Malvern's trunk to the warehouse of Josiah Nidd &amp; Son, Carriers. Since this establishment was situated a bare quarter of a mile from the Bull and Mouth, Miss Malvern had a shrewd suspicion that she was being grossly overcharged; but although an adventurous youth spent in following the drum had accustomed her to haggling with Portuguese farmers and Spanish muleteers, she did not feel inclined to embark on argument in a crowded London inn-yard, so she agreed the price, and desired the porter to lead her to the warehouse.</p> <p>The premises acquired some years earlier by Mr Nidd and his son had originally been an inn, of neither the size nor the quality of the Bull and Mouth, but, like it, provided with a galleried yard, and a number of stables and coach-houses. Occupying a large part of the yard was an enormous wagon mounted on nine-inch cylindrical wheels, and covered by a spreading tilt. Three brawny lads were engaged in loading this vehicle with a collection of goods ranging from pack-cases to farm-implements, their activities being directed, and shrilly criticized, by an aged gentleman, who was seated on the balcony on one side of the yard. Beneath this balcony a glass door had once invited entrance to the coffee-room, but this had been replaced by a green-painted wooden door, flanked by tubs filled with geraniums, and furnished with a bright brass knocker, indicating that the erstwhile hostelry had become a private residence. Picking her way between the piles of packages, and directing the porter to follow her, Miss Malvern went to it, lifting its latch without ceremony, and stepping into a narrow passage, from which a door gave access into the old coffeeroom, and a flight of uneven stairs rose to the upper floors. The trunk set down, and the porter dismissed, Miss Malvern heaved a sigh of relief, as of one who had accomplished an enterprise fraught with peril, and called: 'Sarah?'</p> <p>No immediate response being forthcoming, she called again, more loudly, and moved to the foot of the stairs. But even as she set her foot on the bottom step, a door at the end of the passage burst open, and a lady in a flowered print dress, with an old-fashioned tucker round her ample bosom, and a starched muslin cap tied in a bow beneath her chin, stood as though stunned on the threshold, and gasped: 'Miss Kate! It's never you! Oh, my dearie, my precious lambkin!'</p> <p>She started forward, holding out her plump arms, and Miss Malvern, laughing and crying, tumbled into them, hugging her, and uttering disjointedly: 'Oh, Sarah, oh, Sarah! To be with you again! I've been thinking of nothing else, all the way! Oh, Sarah, I'm so tired, and dispirited, and there was nowhere else for me to go, but indeed I don't mean to impose on you, or on poor Mr Nidd! Only until I can find another situation!' </p> <p>Several teardrops stood on Mrs Nidd's cheeks, but she said in a scolding voice: 'Now, that's no way to talk, Miss Kate, and well you know it! And where else should you go, I should like to know? Now, you come into the kitchen, like a good girl, while I pop the kettle on, and cut some bread-and-butter!'</p> <p>Miss Malvern dried her eyes, and sighed: 'Oh, dear, would you have believed I could be so ticklish? It was such a horrid journey &#x2014; six of us inside! &#x2014; and no time to swallow more than a sip of coffee when we stopped for breakfast.'</p> <p>Mrs Nidd, leading her into the kitchen, and thrusting her into a chair, demanded: 'Are you telling me you came on the common stage, Miss Kate?'</p> <p>'Yes, of course I did. Well, you couldn't expect them to have sent me by post, could you? And if you're thinking of the Mail, I am excessively glad they didn't send me by that either, because it reached London just after four o'clock in the morning! What should I have done?'</p> (20090527)</p><h2>Pure Desire: How One Man&#39;s Triumph Can Help Others Break Free From Sexual Temptation</h2><p>There is a battle going on with millions of victims trapped in the struggle and no apparent way out.

It begins with a historical introduction to symbols, ranging from ancient times to modern fictitious characters that reflect characteristics of ancient gods and goddesses.<p>The entries are grouped into four major categories: mythologies and religions; nature; people; and symbol systems (e.g., mathematical symbols, traffic signs). Each symbol is represented by a colorful photograph or painting. A short paragraph explains the origin of the symbol, as well as geographical or historical variations in meaning. For example, the entry on the Roman goddess <i>Minerva</i> discusses her Roman significance as well as her Greek counterpart, <i>Athena</i>. A clear cross-referencing system uses <i>see also</i> boxes. For example, the entry <i>legs</i>, found in the <i>People</i> section under human body and described as possibly representing the swift-footed sun, is cross-referenced to <i>triskele</i>, described as the movement of the sun. Useful are the glossary of terms, additional reading selections, and a detailed index found at the end of the book.</p><p><i>The Illustrated Book of Signs &amp; Symbols</i> is a good basic resource for public and school libraries for readers of all ages. However, far more extensive treatment of symbols can be found in <i>The Dictionary of Symbolism</i> (Facts On File, 1992) and <i>Dictionary of Symbols</i> (ABC-Clio, 1991). <i></i></p>Signs and symbols are parts of our lives that are often unnoticed or, if noticed, are not always understood. With this lavishly illustrated book, the author looks at the essence of signs and symbols and defines many of them in brief and simple terms. Bruce-Mitford, a contributor to The World Directory of Minorities (Longman, 1990) and a lecturer at the British Museum, covers a wide variety of symbols, explaining their significance from cultural perspectives throughout the world views. The introductory chapter discusses the differences between signs and symbols and offers brief overviews of ancient, universal, and modern symbols. The main body of the work divides signs and symbols into major categories such as mythologies, nature, and people. Within the categories are items such as ancient deities, planets, clothing, and international signs. Very handy cross-referencing on many pages leads the reader to related symbols. A useful glossary, index, and additional reading list complete the book. For lengthier and more comprehensive coverage of signs and symbols, Carl G. Liungman's Dictionary of Symbols (LJ 12/91) or Hans Biedermann's Dictionary of Symbolism (LJ 9/1/92) will serve better, but for straightforward definitions and excellent color illustrations, this book will be quite helpful.

To this day the crash remains clouded in doubt and shadowed by suspicion of a government conspiracy.</p><p>If there was any conspiracy to hide the truth about what really happened to Flight 800, it began long before the crash. Past crashes tell the story: What happened on Flight 800 has happened before and will again, unless drastic changes are made. Now veteran journalist Christine Negroni reveals what the commercial aviation industry has known for more than thirty-five years that during flight confined vapors in the fuel tanks can create a bomb like environment. It takes only a small energy source to ignite it.</p><p>TWA Flight 800 was the fourteenth fuel tank explosion on a commercial airliner in thirty-five years. Yet each and every time, the airline industry persuaded regulators to deal with the symptoms of the problem and ignore the cause. When investigators could not immediately determine what happened, they were finally forced to look at the bigger picture. And, for the first time, this book exposes the hubris of aircraft manufacturers who knew all along, but dismissed as acceptable, the risk of fuel tank explosions.</p><p><em>Deadly Departure</em> shines a spotlight on the chaos behind the most massive crash investigation ever conducted, how the White House had to intervene between feuding investigators, and the surprising stories behind the missile theory conspiracies. It also tells the stories of the passengers and their families, the people of TWA and Boeing, the rescue and crisis workers, and the investigators and scientists involved illustrating the devastating effects on human lives. An impeccably researched, eye-opening examination of one of the great disasters of our time, <em>Deadly Departure</em> is a stunning expos� of how industry pressure continues to undermine regulatory policy, placing air travelers' lives at risk.</p></p><p>Though it can be classified as airplane reading, you may not want to bring <i>Deadly Departure</i> with you on your next flight. In this gripping story of the investigation of the crash of TWA Flight 800, aviation correspondent Christine Negroni guides the reader through the intricacies of the U.S. government's most expensive crash investigation to date. Personal stories of passengers, their families, crash investigators, rescue workers, conspiracy theorists, and employees of Boeing and TWA underpin Negroni's account of the investigation as a catalog of conflict, incompetence, and deceit. She concludes that, contrary to the claims of aircraft manufacturers, fuel tank explosions are a real danger, but one that lies within the range of acceptable risk for both the industry and the Federal Aviation Authority. <blockquote> If there was a conspiracy to hide the truth about what really happened to Flight 800, it began long before the crash, and it wasn't an effort to cover up action, it was a conspiracy of inaction. Although the newspapers were filled with experts insisting planes don't just fall out of the sky and fuel tank explosions can't bring down an airplane, insiders knew different. </blockquote> If you have followed the strange and sad saga of TWA 800's mysterious end and its aftermath, Negroni's book is for you. <i>--Julia Riches</i><p>Christine Negroni is an award-winning broadcast journalist.

Daoism, as this subtle but enduring philosophy came to be known, offers a comprehensive view of experience grounded in a full understanding of the wonders hidden in the ordinary. Now in this luminous new translation, based on the recently discovered ancient bamboo scrolls, China scholars Roger T. Ames and David L. Hall bring the timeless wisdom of the <i>Dao de jing</i> into our contemporary world.<br><br>Though attributed to Laozi, &#x201c;the Old Master,&#x201d; the <i>Dao de jing</i> is, in fact, of unknown authorship and may well have originated in an oral tradition four hundred years before the time of Christ. Eschewing philosophical dogma, the <i>Dao de jing</i> set forth a series of maxims that outlined a new perspective on reality and invited readers to embark on a regimen of self-cultivation. In the Daoist world view, each particular element in our experience sends out an endless series of ripples throughout the cosmos. The unstated goal of the <i>Dao de jing</i> is self-transformation&#x2013;the attainment of personal excellence that flows from the world and back into it. Responding to the teachings of Confucius, the <i>Dao de jing</i> revitalizes moral behavior by recommending a spontaneity made possible by the cultivated &#x201c;habits&#x201d; of the individual.<br><br>In this elegant volume, Ames and Hall feature the original Chinese texts of the <i>Dao de jing </i>and translate them into crisp, chiseled English that reads like poetry. Each of the eighty-one brief chapters is followed by clear, thought-provoking commentary exploring the layers of meaning in the text. The book&#x2019;s extensive introduction is a model of accessible scholarship in which Ames and Hall consider the origin of the text, place the emergence of Daoist philosophy in its historical and political context, and outline its central tenets. <br><br>The <i>Dao de jing</i> is a work of timeless wisdom and beauty, as vital today as it was in ancient China. This new version will stand as both a compelling introduction to the complexities of Daoist thought and as the classic modern English translation.</p><p>&#x201c;A NEW ENGLISH VERSION OF THE CLASSIC CHINESE <i>DAO DE JING</i> . . .

One vanishes from a movie theater. Another, from her car at a stoplight. A mother is ripped from her home while checking on her baby. Rookie FBI agent Caitlin Hendrix, newly assigned to the FBI's elite Behavioral Analysis Unit, fears that a serial killer is roaming the dark roads outside Austin.<br><br>Caitlin's unit discovers the first victim's body in the woods, laid out in a bloodstained white baby-doll nightgown. A second victim in a white nightie lies deeper in the forest's darkness. Around the bodies, Polaroid photos are stuck in the earth like headstones, picturing other women with their wrists slashed. The women in the woods are not the killer's first victims, nor are they likely to be his last. <br><br>To track the UNSUB, Caitlin must get inside his mind; he is a confident, meticulous killer, capable of charming his victims until their guard is down, snatching them in plain sight. He then plays out a twisted fantasy&#x2014;turning them into dolls for him to possess, control, and ultimately destroy. Caitlin's profile leads the FBI to focus on one man: a charismatic, successful professional who easily gains people's trust. But can they apprehend him before it's too late? As Saturday night approaches, Caitlin and the FBI enter a desperate game of cat and mouse, racing to capture the cunning predator before he claims his next victim.</p><p><b>MEG GARDINER</b> is the author of thirteen critically acclaimed novels, including <i>UNSUB </i>and <i>China Lake</i>, which won the Edgar Award.

Shana Kerber roused and squinted at the clock. Twelve forty five A.M.</p><p>Her voice came as a sigh. "Already:"</p><p>Shana huddled for a minute under the comforter, clinging wish fully to warmth and sleep. <i>Hush yourself, Jaydee. Please. </i>But the baby's crying intensified. It was her strong, wide awake, <i>I'm hungry </i>cry.</p><p>The night was bitter. Early February, the north wind scouring Texas. It whistled through the cracks in the farmhouse, rattling the doors in their frames. Shana rolled over. The other side of the bed was cool. Brandon wasn't home yet.</p><p>For a few more seconds Shana lay still, aching with fatigue, hoping Jaydee would quiet. But she was crying to beat the band. Ten months old and still up twice a night. Shana's mom swore things would get easier. She'd been swearing so for months. <i>When, Mom? Please, when?</i></p><p>"Coming, baby," Shana murmured.</p><p>She tossed back the covers, brushed her sleep tangled hair from her face, and slogged out of the bedroom. The hardwood floor creaked beneath her bare feet. Jaydee's cries grew clearer.</p><p>Six feet down the hall, she slowed. The crying wasn't coming from the nursery.</p><p>The house was completely dark. Jaydee was too little to climb out of her crib.</p><p>Shana turned on the hall light. The nursery door was open.</p><p>A sliver of ice seemed to slide through her chest. At the far end of the hall she could see into the living room. On the sofa, half lit by<i> </i>the hall light, a stranger sat holding her little girl on his lap.</p><p>The icy sliver sank through Shana. "What are you doing here?'</p><p>"Don't worry. I'm a friend of your husband." The man's face was in shadow. His voice was soothing-almost warm. "She was crying. Didn't want to wake you."</p><p>He seemed completely relaxed. Shana walked slowly to the living room. She glanced out the front window. The moon was full. An SUV was parked outside. A placard hung from the rearview mirror.</p><p>"Is that..." She looked him up and down. "Army? Are you ..."</p><p>The baby twisted in the man's arms. He bounced her. "She's quite the little doll."</p><p>He tickled Jaydee and made baby talk. Shana tried harder to see his face. His eyes remained in shadow. Something stopped her from turning on the table lamp.</p><p><i>Is he a friend of Brandon's?</i></p><p>Shana extended her hands. "I&#x2019;ll take her."</p><p>The wind battered the windows. The man's smile persisted. Though she couldn't see his eyes, Shana had a gut certainty that he was watching her.</p><p>She edged forward. She was eight feet from him. Out of his reach. "Give Jaydee to me."</p><p>&nbsp;He didn't.</p><p>Her hands were open. "Please."</p><p>Jaydee twisted in the man's arms. Her chubby legs pumped like pistons. Shana's heart thundered. She saw the power in the man's hands and knew she couldn't simply charge at him.</p><p>The shotgun was under her bed. Five seconds was what it would take to run to the bedroom, grab it, and rush back down the hall. It was a twelve gauge. It was loaded.</p><p>And it was useless, because this man was holding her child to his chest. Her breathing caught, like a cloth snagging on a nail.</p><p>She inched forward. "Give her here."</p><p>For a few seconds, he continued bouncing Jaydee. Crying, the little girl reached starfish fingers toward Shana.</p><p>"She wants her mama," the man said. "Aww, come here."</p><p>Shana held still, her own arms outstretched. "Give me my baby."</p><p>The smile stiffened. The man set Jaydee gently beside him on the sofa.</p><p>Before Shana could inhale, he lowered his shoulders, gathering himself. He was in motion when the light finally hit his eyes.</p><p>The dashboard clock read one thirty A.M. when Brandon Kerber turned into the gravel driveway. The truck bounced over the ruts, stereo blasting Chris Stapleton. Brandon whistled along. His rare Saturday night out had been golden-a Spurs game in San Antonio with friends from his army days. He curved past the stand of cedars and the house came into view.</p><p>"What ..."</p><p>The front door was open.</p><p>Brandon gunned the F-150 up to the house. The windows reflected the truck's headlights like wild eyes. He jumped out. In the wind, the door was banging back against the wall. An acid taste burned his throat. Banging that loud should have woken Shana up. Inside the darkened house, he heard a mournful sound.</p><p>Crying.</p><p>Brandon rushed in. The living room was cold. The headlights threw his shadow ahead of him on the floor like a blade. The crying kept up. It was the baby.</p><p>Jaydee lay huddled on the floor. He scooped her up. "Shana?"</p><p>He hit a light switch. The living room lit up, neat, clean, and empty. Jaydee's eyes were red rimmed. She was exhausted from sobbing. He pulled her to his chest. Her cries diminished to pathetic hiccups.</p><p><i>"Shana."</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Brandon ran to the bedroom with the baby and flipped on the light. He spun and strode down the hall, looking in the nursery. In the kitchen. The garage. The back porch.</p><p>Nothing. Shana was gone.</p><p>He stood in the living room, clutching Jaydee, telling himself, <i>She's here. I just can't see her.</i></p><p>But the truth closed in on him. Shana had vanished.</p><p>She was the fifth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>Early morning shadows slashed the road. The sun blazed gold through the pines.

Caitlin flipped through hers.</p><p><i>Escalation. </i>She scanned the pages in the file, looking for exactly what that word meant in this case.</p><p>She was no longer a raw rookie but was still finding her feet as a criminal profiler. She had a cop's experience and instincts; she was learning to interpret crime scene evidence, forensics, and victimology to build a picture of a perpetrator. Profiling was based on the insight that everything at a crime scene tells a story and reveals something about the criminal. The BAU studied offender behavior to uncover how they thought, predict how they would escalate-and apprehend them before they could put any others in danger.</p><p>"The victims have been taken from public places and their own homes," Emmerich said. "No witnesses, and so far, no probative forensic evidence.

Your brain contains one hundred billion cells, each connected to about twenty thousand other cells. This means that the possible thoughts you can think, positive or negative, are greater than the number of molecules in the known universe.<br><br> You are capable, right now, of living a wonderful life full of meaning and purpose, having a positive effect on numerous people.<br><br> But before you can realize your full potential for personal greatness, you need to understand who you are and how you got to where you are today.<br><br> There Is No Instruction Manual for Life, So Create Your Own!<br><br> Imagine that you had purchased the most sophisticated computer setup, plus accessories, that you could imagine. You brought it home, took it out of the box, and found to your amazement that there was no instruction manual. You had all this wonderful modern equipment that could perform many complicated tasks, but you did not know how to set it up or use it properly.<br><br> You are born very much the same. You come into the world with a marvelous mind, loaded with untapped talents and abilities, with the potential to do extraordinary things with your life. But you have no instruction manual. You have to figure it all out for yourself. And this usually takes years, if not an entire lifetime.<br><br> Have you ever wondered how you became the person you are today, with your special combination of thoughts, feelings, ideas, abilities, fears, hopes, ambitions, and aspirations?<br><br> The Magic of Changing Your Thinking<br><br> Thomas Edison once said, "There are three types of people: There are those who think. There are those who think they think. And then there are those who would rather die than think."<br><br> The great majority of people go through life without giving much thought to who they are and how they got to where they are today. As a result, life just happens to them, like a series of random events, with no explanations and few connections between them.<br><br> They take the first job that is offered to them, do what they are told, and then other people who offer them other jobs largely determine their career. They marry the person who happens to be standing there when they decide that they don't want to be single anymore. They spend their money on whatever appeals to them and invest in whatever somebody suggests to them. For the average person, life is like a bumper car at the carnival, continually being knocked in different directions, with very little control.<br><br> But the fact is that your world is largely created by the thoughts you think, and the things that you do as a result of your thinking. When you improve your thinking, you improve your actions and your results. When you change your thinking, you change your life.<br><br> A Word from Christina<br><br> A powerful example of how changing your thinking can change your life comes from an experience with a client of mine. A forty-year-old man came to me because he realized he was tired of not feeling happy with his life. He had a good relationship with his wife and two happy kids, a well-paying job, and a supportive group of family and friends.<br><br> He just felt like something was missing and he wasn't able to appreciate his situation. What I realized in working with him was that he had a general attitude of pessimism that was directly linked to his belief that he did not have control of his life. This thinking pattern was causing him to feel anxious and depressed about some unknown impending doom that he could not avoid. We broke his life down into separate parts and identified how and where he in fact was in control of his life.<br><br> I gave him exercises to reinforce this new belief. He began practicing making decisions and taking actions that demonstrated that he was in control. Over time he became more relaxed and easygoing. Eventually, his whole attitude changed completely. He became much more optimistic and positive about his life. The turning point for him was when he shifted his perception and chose to interpret things differently. He saw himself as being in control of his choices and decisions, and therefore in control of his future. His life changed completely.<br><br> The Mental Laws<br><br> There is a series of mental laws and principles that have been discovered and rediscovered throughout history. These laws largely explain who you are and everything that happens to you. As success authority Napoleon Hill wrote, "One of the great secrets in life is never attempt to violate natural laws and win."<br><br> The Law of Cause and Effect<br><br> This is often referred to as the iron law of the universe. It was first explained by Aristotle in 350 bc at his academy outside Athens, and was called the "Aristotelian principle of causality."<br><br> At a time when everyone believed that the lives of mortals were determined by the gods playing on Mount Olympus and were nothing but a series of random events, Aristotle instead proclaimed that we live in a universe governed by order. He said that everything happens for a reason. Just because we do not know the reason, that does not mean a reason does not exist.<br><br> The law of cause and effect says that for every effect or result in your life there is a cause or causes. Nothing happens by chance. Even the most random events can be traced back to specific causes or factors.<br><br> This law also says that if there is an effect that you desire, such as health, happiness, prosperity, or success, you can achieve that effect by creating the causes that bring them about. The easiest way to succeed greatly is to find someone else who has already achieved what you want to achieve and then do the same things this person did, over and over, until you get the same results.<br><br> Exercise: Write down the names of three people you admire, whether for the people they are or for something they have accomplished. What is the quality you admire most about each one of them? How can you develop those qualities in yourself?<br><br> Here's the first rule of the law of cause and effect: If you do what successful, happy people do, over and over, there is nothing that can stop you from eventually getting the same results that they do.<br><br> The second rule is this: If you don't do what successful, happy people do, nothing can help you.<br><br> The world is full of people who are doing what unhappy, unsuccessful, frustrated people do, and then they are amazed that they get the same results. But this is not a matter of accident, random chance, or bad luck. It is simply a matter of law.<br><br> If you eat healthy foods, exercise regularly, and take good care of your body, you will be fit and trim, and have high levels of energy. And if you don't, you won't. Everyone understands and agrees with this. It is obvious. It is simply a matter of cause and effect.<br><br> Your Thought Is Creative<br><br> The most important application of the law of cause and effect is this: Thoughts are causes, and conditions are effects.<br><br> Your thought is creative. You determine what happens to you by the thoughts you think, especially those thoughts that are charged with emotion, either positive or negative. Your thoughts are like the computer in a guided missile. They lead you unerringly to your target.<br><br> Here's a critical point: Once you have initiated the cause, the effect takes place by itself. Once you have pushed the rock down the hill, it rolls by itself, by the law of gravity. Once you have planted a positive or negative seed in your mind, either flowers or weeds will grow. You can control the cause, but the effect happens automatically, whether you want it to or not.<br><br> A Word from Christina<br><br> Often, when people first come to see me for therapy, I like to take time to explore a client's "garden" and find out which positive or negative thoughts, ideas, and beliefs have been planted and exist as a part of his or her personal story. Seeds are planted from the time a person is born, by others, and then they continue to be planted by us.<br><br> It is vital to identify what thoughts and ideas already exist so that the client can then decide which plants should remain in the garden and which should be removed because they are no longer true for him or her. From then on, the client's mental garden must be nurtured. It contains all the thoughts, ideas, and emotions that make up a person's inner life.<br><br> Think About Success<br><br> In a twenty-two-year study at the University of Pennsylvania, 350,000 people were interviewed to find out what they thought about most of the time. It turned out that the top 10 percent, the happiest and most successful of this group, thought about two things most of the time: what they wanted and how to get it. They thought about their goals and the actions they could take to achieve them.<br><br> Exercise: Decide upon something that you really want. Now imagine that you have already achieved it. Describe what it's like to have attained your goal. How would your life be different if you achieved something that is important to you?<br><br> The more that successful people thought about what they wanted and how to get it, the more ideas and insights came to them. These ideas motivated them to take even more actions, which moved them faster and faster toward their goals. When they achieved their goals, they felt happier, more motivated, and eager to set even bigger and more challenging goals. By thinking most of the time about what they wanted and how to get it, they put their lives into an upward spiral of success and achievement. And so can you.<br><br> The Foundation Principle<br><br> The foundation principle of all religions, philosophy, metaphysics, psychology, and success is this: You become what you think about most of the time.<br><br> When you think clear, definite thoughts about what you want, backed by the positive emotion of enthusiasm, you direct and channel your energies and your activities toward your goals.<br><br> If your mind is a jumble of thoughts, as it is for most people, you will think about what you want on some occasions, and what you don't want on others. You will think about what makes you happy and about what makes you unhappy. You will think about going to work and coming home. You will think about going to bed and getting up. You will think about fun and short-term excitement, watching television, listening to music, and socializing. Because you have no clear, specific goals, your life simply goes around in circles, sometimes for years. You eventually become what you think about, most of the time, for good or ill.<br><br> The Law of Belief<br><br> The law of belief says that whatever you believe with emotion becomes your reality. Your beliefs form a screen of prejudices through which you see your world. In other words, you do not see the world the way it is, but the way you are.<br><br> William James, the nineteenth-century Harvard University psychologist, said, "Belief creates the actual fact."<br><br> You always think and act based on your basic beliefs, either positive or negative. If you have positive, constructive beliefs, you will make good decisions, take correct actions, and get good results. If you have negative, fearful, or angry beliefs, you will take the wrong actions or no actions at all, and get negative results. This is simply a matter of law.<br><br> Exercise: Get a notebook and keep it with you throughout the day. Become aware of how you perceive situations. When faced with a decision, do you highlight the positives or consider the negatives first? Track these thought patterns and make a conscious effort to view things optimistically. Then track how you feel overall about your day. Make sure you write this down.<br><br> All Beliefs Are Learned<br><br> Fortunately, all beliefs are learned. Everything that you are convinced of today has been taught to you somehow and by someone. If you have positive, life-affirming beliefs, you will have a happy, healthy life. You will be popular and get along well with other people.<br><br> If you have negative, destructive beliefs, you will be doubtful, fearful, suspicious, negative, and in constant conflict with other people in your life.<br><br> The starting point of personal transformation is to question your self-limiting beliefs. Any beliefs you have that suggest you are limited in talent, ability, personality, or opportunity are usually not true. They are limitations that you have imposed upon yourself by believing in them. The minute you stop believing that you are limited in any way, your whole life opens up, like a sunrise.<br><br> A Word from Christina<br><br> I was recently working with a woman who would experience tremendous anxiety each time she anticipated having a conversation with a particular coworker. She claimed she felt small and intimidated by this coworker and had a hard time speaking up for what she needed or wanted in the presence of this other person.<br><br> I had her imagine herself feeling really small, insecure, and intimidated and then I asked her to associate those feelings with an animal. She chose a kitten because they are often shy and timid. I then asked her to think of a time when she felt grounded, confident, and powerful. I asked her to associate those feelings with an animal. She chose a tiger because tigers are powerful and dangerous. I then had her practice imagining herself as a kitten and then a tiger. We did this several times until she felt she could easily connect to the feelings she had associated with each animal. She began practicing being her tiger self at work and found that the anxiety of talking with her coworker completely went away.<br><br> I have conducted this particular exercise with several clients, and every time the client came back to me with a success story. It seems unusual, but taking your self-limiting beliefs and creating a concrete object or animal to represent them allows you to externalize them and become more aware of what mind-set you are operating from. Being able to identify when you are feeling insecure and consciously shift yourself to come from a confident, empowered place gives you a sense of control and boosts your self-esteem.<br><br> Exercise: What are three things that you want to do but think you can't do? Why can't you do them? Who tells you that you can't do those things? Who believes you can? Have you ever tried to do these things, or are you just assuming you can't?</p><h2>The Thin Commandments Diet: The 10 No-fail Strategies For Permanent Weight Loss</h2><p>Bestselling author of Thin Tastes Better, Dr. Stephen Gullo lets you in on his unique program that has a success rate almost 15 times higher than the national average and has helped patients lose more than 100 pounds and maintain the weight loss for more than 5 years.

Use strategy to stay in control.<br><br>. Stop self-defeating food talk.<br><br>. Weigh yourself on the New Scale for Dieting.<br><br>. Keep a food diary.<br><br>. Listen to a power tape.<br><br>THE SINGLE GREATEST SURPRISE of my professional life has been the discovery that success at weight control is not about willpower. Indeed, those who succeed at weight control do not have greater willpower than those who fail- -they just have better strategies. This is the most powerful lesson I have learned in 25 years from almost 15,000 clients.<br><br>Like you--and many of my colleagues--I once had quite a few preconceptions about people with weight problems: They lack willpower to control their eating; they have psychological or emotional issues that keep them from permanently losing weight; and they lack the food smarts to follow a healthy diet.<br><br>When I actually began to work with these individuals, I discovered that almost all of my preconceptions were wrong. They were successful in their professional lives, enjoyed many interests, and had meaningful personal relationships. They were creative people with vision, who cared passionately about their goals and were dedicated to excellence. They epitomized the American ideal of determination and success.<br><br>Far from lacking nutritional knowledge, many of my clients already knew what to eat and what not to eat. They'd read diet book after diet book, were aware of calories, carbohydrates, and fats, and knew how to read labels. Many had lost hundreds of �ds over the years. But despite all their knowledge and weight loss, they had never been able to keep the �ds off permanently.<br><br>I struggled to reconcile my clients' success in every other area of their lives with their failure at weight control. How could these people--many of whom had overcome tremendous obstacles to achieve greatness--still lose control with chocolates or a breadbasket? They knew what they had to do to lose weight, but they were living in misery because they couldn't do it. Such repeated failure takes a terrible toll, even on the most successful individual.<br><br>WHY WE FAIL<br><br>By looking back across the years at my clients' dieting, weight loss, and gain, I've seen that there are distinct and predictable patterns of behavior and food choices that have led these men and women to failure. I have conclusively discovered that the particular diet an individual follows is secondary to success at weight control, which is why people can so easily switch diets from year to year. The most important factor for winning is having strategies--not the particular diet you follow.<br><br>In a recent article "The Diet That Works" in the Wall Street Journal, Tara Parker Pope captured the truth that resonates for a large number of individuals who struggle with weight control. "If sticking to a diet were easy, so many of us wouldn't be so fat."<br><br>The men and women who have avoided a weight problem--or conquered one on their own--instinctively use strategy to stay in control. It's the common thread that unites everyone who has ever won at weight control, including myself. Food strategy has saved me again and again in my own life.<br><br>Obviously, no one who has lost weight intends to gain it back. After every diet, every one of my clients was completely committed to maintaining his or her weight loss. But the commitment was overcome by a combination of powerful forces: biology, our value system, and advertising.<br><br>Recent research shows that our ancestors passed on powerful biological programming that may predispose us to crave and seek out certain foods, as many of us who are sensitive to sweet, salty, and bitter tastes know well. These differences in sensitivity, not willpower, may explain why some people are able to maintain control around certain foods--such as chocolate chip cookies--while others find that these foods actually trigger increased appetite and losses of control.<br><br>And unlike many of our ancestors, who had to struggle to find food, we are literally surrounded by it. Yet we still carry the ancestral mindset of "waste not, want not" in our modern society where food is overly abundant and always present. Just consider all of the food stores, fast-food chains, airport and shopping mall food courts--many of them open 24 hours a day! Overconsumption is the name of the game, and "all-you-can-eat" has become a national mantra. We have been steadily programmed to believe that it is our birthright to eat whatever we want, whenever we want. We're also bombarded by slick commercials that reinforce the belief that foods are the goodies and treats that make life worthwhile and wash away stress--and that any limitation of them is a horrible deprivation. Even the language of love is expressed in terms of food--honey, cookie, peaches, sweetie. And when you fall out of love, that person becomes a crumb!<br><br>Saddled with this powerful psychological and biological programming, surrounded by messages that food is the answer to every problem and the reward for every success, it's no wonder so many people fall back into the habits that lead to weight gain. And it's totally clear why so many feel instantly deprived when they think about weight control.<br><br>STRATEGY: THE KEY PRINCIPLES<br><br>Food situations are a part of every life. They come up again and again, and there's an amazing amount of predictability to what you can expect to encounter. Most of us rely on a very small assortment of foods--the same vegetables, the same meats, the same snack foods that satisfy an eat-and- run diet. Despite the fact that we can buy practically any food at any time, no matter how exotic or out of season, few of us venture beyond the limits of our favorite foods. And most eating occurs in only about seven situations: at home, in the workplace, in restaurants, in others' homes, when traveling, on vacation, and at celebratory events, such as holiday dinners, weddings, and parties. The realm of food is not a big world, but a small village.<br><br>The same scenarios come up over and over again. You face the same foods, the same temptations. However overwhelmed you may feel in the land of abundance, there is another more powerful truth at work as well: You have seen it all and tasted it all before. It may come in different shapes, varieties, and new presentations, but there's very little that's new in the world of food that you will face today. I will teach you strategies to deal with each situation. And I'll show you ways to develop your skills so that your responses become automatic. Rather than a constant tug-of-war that drains your willpower and resolve, you will have a set of tools to rely on, no matter where you go or what foods you may meet along the way.<br><br>Although food strategies vary depending on the person, the techniques share common themes. This chapter and those that follow will teach you a new way of dealing with your weight that involves key principles that have enabled so many of my clients to turn a lifetime of failure with weight into a lifetime of success.<br><br>. Food history. In a world of thousands of types of food, my careful research has revealed that only a handful are at the root of most weight problems. Food history shows that weight control is not a mountain to climb, just a few patterns to master.<br><br>. Food desensitizing. Techniques to defuse the power of cravings so that you can be around food that would normally tempt you without feeling deprived.<br><br>. Breaking through food "baby talk." Methods to transform self-defeating food talk learned in childhood--that can rule and ruin adulthood--into a new script, with phrases, thoughts, and values that work in the real world and prove that anyone can overcome feelings of deprivation.<br><br>. The New Scale for Dieting. A unique and effective tool for measuring the shifts and changes in your attitudes, skills, and motivation that can result in increased �ds, to be used as an early warning system before you step on a real scale. The New Scale for Dieting predicts in advance if you'll be gaining weight and makes it possible to prevent the seven most critical mistakes that lead to weight gain. This has never before been done in a weight program.<br><br>. Containment. The powerful technique that turns slips into success and teaches you how to cut off an error and never again feel the guilt of "I blew it."<br><br>. Keeping the pleasure of food. Enjoying favorite foods and not feeling deprived is critical for your success. Through recipes and food preparation techniques in my diet plan, you'll discover how to preserve the joy of eating without excess calories, and you will learn the best of the best of the new light foods, which my clients and I have tasted for you. Of the thousands of products we've sampled, only a handful have merited our Taste Is King award. And the gourmet recipes will prove that success at weight control is not about giving up the pleasure of fine dining. Indeed, not to enjoy the foods on a weight plan guarantees failure!<br><br>Whenever I teach new clients the techniques for weight control, I know that I am training them for "diet fitness." For, just as you can become physically fit and train for a sport, every overweight person has the ability to become psychologically fit and train for long-term weight control. These strategies, along with many others that I will teach you, make it possible not only to dramatically increase your likelihood for success on a diet but also to maintain that success for years.<br><br>Some of these strategies may seem unusual or contradict what you have been led to believe about dieting and weight control. But successful weight control is not about doing what's "normal"--it's about doing what works for you. You should not be concerned about the norm--that's the preoccupation of the insecure--but about what brings you the success you deserve. As Chairman Deng responded when criticized by the Communist hardliners for introducing capitalist initiatives into China, "It doesn't matter if the cat is black or white; it only matters if it can catch mice."<br><br>DIETS ARE JUST WORDS ON A PAGE<br><br>Most of the diet books out there today focus on only half the equation: the right foods. But that leaves out the most critical element for success-- you! Diets are just words on a page, a list on paper of what to eat. They don't help you plan what to think or say, and they don't tell you how to behave. They ignore the right behaviors, the critical issues of how to stay motivated and how to bounce back from a lapse, and how to avoid cravings and feelings of deprivation, and they don't change your thinking about food.<br><br>Strategy deals with how to make weight control easy. The right techniques actually encourage you to want to continue. They lead you to a way of eating that makes you feel happier and brings about permanent results by changing your mindset. At the core of the lessons I teach is changing the food programming that you've been taught since childhood.<br><br>The Lure of Food "Baby Talk"<br><br>When faced with cravings and feelings of deprivation, most dieters slide straight back into childhood--and that language that goes with it. "But it's my favorite." "It's not fair that I can't have it." "But I've been so good." "It's my comfort." "It's my treat." "I'll reward myself." This food "baby talk" is at the heart of many people's weight problems, drowning out their common sense and even their desire for health and sometimes life itself.<br><br>For many of my clients, this is the only area in their lives still run by the childhood patterns of thinking and conditioning. Indeed, for so many of us, it is the single area of living where childhood thinking has never been updated. Where food is concerned, even the most mature adults often act like children--like children who want their way no matter what, blocking out the negative consequences of their eating. They focus instead on a few minutes' worth of taste that fills the mouth and lingers for a short while, while completely denying the obvious and discomforting cost.<br><br>For these foods are not free--you have to wear them for years to come. You can't eat it all and still be thin. This is a fact. But you can be a selective gourmet and never have to give up the pleasure of fine dining.<br><br>Food is everywhere, and because it so often looks and tastes great, it's easy for us to continue to live in this childish mindset, telling ourselves "these are my goodies and treats." And we often listen to the message-- until it creates disaster. The challenge is that the food is immediate, but the cost is often paid on the "layaway" plan. And like most layaway plans, the interest is high. Perhaps you have only to look in the mirror?<br><br>Only children live their lives believing they can have it all without any cost. Now it's time for you to bring this part of your life into the adult world. All of life contains adjustments and tradeoffs. In accepting this, you not only establish a framework for lasting solutions to your weight problem, but you become a more resilient and mature human being. It's time to stop resenting what you do to keep your body healthy and attractive. Everything you value in your life--your relationships, your children, and your career--has taken work, focus, and endurance. Why should it be any different when it comes to managing your weight? Strategy, however, minimizes the cost and maximizes the reward.<br><br>The winners have come to this realization, and they no longer feel deprived, but liberated. In a recent survey of my clients, 86 percent said they felt no sense of deprivation. Without taking this step of growth and maturation, there can be no permanent weight loss, no permanent freedom. They've taken a turn in their evolution--evolving from childhood thinking and values into the adult thinking in the world of foods.<br><br>If you've come this far, you are already well on your way to that understanding and sense of freedom. You bought this book because you want to lose weight, and you want to do better at ongoing weight control. Now the choice to act is yours.<br><br>THREE SIMPLE STEPS<br><br>There are three actions that can encourage your progress, guard it, and enhance it. For thousands of my clients, these have proven to be among the most effective weapons available for arming themselves in their battle with weight.

The ruling Asharites of Al-Rassan have come from the desert sands, but over centuries, seduced by the sensuous pleasures of their new land, their stern piety has eroded. The Asharite empire has splintered into decadent city-states led by warring petty kings. King Almalik of Cartada is on the ascendancy, aided always by his friend and advisor, the notorious Ammar ibn Khairan -- poet, diplomat, soldier -- until a summer afternoon of savage brutality changes their relationship forever. Meanwhile, in the north, the conquered Jaddites&#39; most celebrated -- and feared -- military leader, Rodrigo Belmonte, driven into exile, leads his mercenary company south. In the dangerous lands of Al-Rassan, these two men from different worlds meet and serve -- for a time -- the same master. Sharing their interwoven fate -- and increasingly torn by her feelings -- is Jehane, the accomplished court physician, whose own skills play an increasing role as Al-Rassan is swept to the brink of holy war, and beyond.</p><p><p>GUY GAVRIEL KAY is acknowledged as one of the world&#x2019;s foremost fantasy authors. He is the author of eleven novels, and his works have been translated into twenty-five languages. Kay lives in Toronto with his family. Visit him online at brightweavings.com.</p>Canadian attorney Kay has eschewed the courtroom thriller for fantasy (A Song for Arbonne, etc.). Here he draws on the crumbling empire of medieval Spain to inspire this tale of brutality and romance. Though the setting is the fictitious Al-Rassan, and there are passing references to the "Star-born," any ancillary connection with science fiction is almost irrelevant to the story. Kay provides insightful glimpses into the goals and motives of his many characters, including King Almalik of Cartada, his advisor Ammar ibn Khairan, a young soldier, Alvar de Pellino, and the compelling female physician Jehane. Mindful of the confusion that alternate universes can create for readers, Kay is careful to periodically summarize the current positions of the various factions in the struggles between the many kingdoms in the empire. Studded with poetry that is evocative of Spain (some selections are reminiscent of El Cid), the story is buttressed with convincing cultural and social details and descriptions of medicine as it was practiced in the 12th century. Genre fans looking for more romance and strong female character development will find this an engrossing tale. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Counternarratives</h2><p><p><strong>Conjuring slavery and witchcraft, and with bewitching powers all its own, Counternarratives continually spins history&#x2015;and storytelling&#x2015;on its head</strong></p><p>Ranging from the 17th century to our current moment, and crossing multiple continents, <em>Counternarratives'</em> stories and novellas draw upon memoirs, newspaper accounts, detective stories, interrogation transcripts, and speculative fiction to create new and strange perspectives on our past and present. &#x201c;An Outtake&#x201d; chronicles an escaped slave&#x2019;s take on liberty and the American Revolution;"The Strange History of Our Lady of the Sorrows" presents a bizarre series of events that unfold in a nineteenth-century Kentucky convent; "The Aeronauts" soars between bustling Philadelphia, still-rustic Washington, and the theater of the U.S. Civil War;&nbsp;&#x201c;Rivers,&#x201d; presents a free Jim meeting up decades later with his former raftmate Huckleberry Finn; and in "Acrobatique," the subject of a famous Edgar Degas painting talks back.</p></p><p>John Keene is a former member of the Dark Room Writers Collective, a graduate fellow of Cave Canem, and the recipient of many awards and fellowships&#x2015;including a MacArthur Genius Award, the Windham-Campbell Prize, and the Whiting Foundation Prize for fiction.

Although founded on military expansionism and undoubted exploitation, it developed over the centuries into what has been called &#39;benign autocracy&#39; - the government of many by few, with the active collaboration of most Indians in recognition of a desire for the advancement of their country. Charles Allen&#39;s classic oral history of the period that marked the end of British rule was first published a generation ago.

And you may have thought, "What the hell does that mean?" Enter <i>A Game of You</i> to confound the issue even more, while at the same time standing as a fine example of such a description. This is not an easy book. The characters are dense and unique, while their observations are, as always with Gaiman, refreshingly familiar. Then there's the plot, which grinds along like a coffee mill, in the process breaking down the two worlds of this series, that of the dream and that of the dreamer. Gaiman pushes these worlds to their very extremes--one is a fantasy world with talking animals, a missing princess, and a mysterious villain called the Cuckoo; the other is an urban microcosm inhabited by a drag queen, a punk lesbian couple, and a New York doll named Barbie. In almost every way this book sits at 180 degrees from the earlier four volumes of the Sandman series--although the less it seems to belong to the series, the more it shows its heart. --<i>Jim Pascoe</i><b>Neil Gaiman</b> is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the Newbery Medal-winning&nbsp;<i>The Graveyard Book</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Coraline</i>, the basis for the hit movie.

THE DRIVER'S SEAT follows the final haunted hours of a woman descending into madness.

Women of Color Against Violence, the largest grassroots, multiracial feminist organization in the country, Andrea Smith (Cherokee) is an emerging leader in progressive political circles. In <i>Conquest</i>, Smith places Native American women at the center of her analysis of sexual violence, challenging both conventional definitions of the term and conventional responses to the problem.</p><p>Beginning with the impact of the abuses inflicted on Native American children at state-sanctioned boarding schools from the 1880s to the 1980s, Smith adroitly expands our conception of violence to include environmental racism, population control and the widespread appropriation of Indian cultural practices by whites and other non-natives. Smith deftly connects these and other examples of historical and contemporary colonialism to the high rates of violence against Native American women&#x2014;the most likely women in the United States to die of poverty-related illnesses, be victims of rape and suffer partner abuse.</p><p>Essential reading for scholars and activists, <i>Conquest</i> is the powerful synthesis of <b>Andrea Smith</b>&#x2019;s intellectual and political work to date. By focusing on the impact of sexual violence on Native American women, Smith articulates an agenda that is compelling to feminists, Native Americans, other people of color and all who are committed to creating viable alternatives to state-based &#x201c;solutions.&#x201d;</p></p><p><br>Assistant professor in Native American Studies at University of Michigan, Smith cofounded INCITE!

Andrea Smith has not only meticulously researched the place of rape and violence against Indigenous women in the colonial process, but she is the first to fully articulate the connections between violence against the earth, violence against women, and North America's terrible inclination toward war."<br> (Lee Maracle, author of <i>I Am Woman: A Native Perspective on Sociology and Feminism</i>)<br><br>"Andrea Smith has no fear. She challenges conventional activist thinking about global and local, sexism and racism, genocide and imperialism. But what's more, in every chapter she tries to answer the key question: What is to be done? <i>Conquest</i> is unsettling, ambitious, brilliant, disturbing: read it, debate it, use it." (Ruth Wilson Gilmore, The Graduate Center, City University of New York)<br><br>"Andrea Smith brilliantly weaves together feminist explanations of violence against Native women, the historical data regarding colonialism and genocide, and a strong critique of the current responses to the gender violence against women of color . . . <i>Conquest</i> is one of the most significant contributions to the literature in Native Studies, feminist theory, and social movement theory in recent years." (Beth E. Richie, author of <i>Compelled to Crime: The Gender Entrapment of Battered Black Women</i>)<br><br>"Whether it is our reliance on the criminal justice system to protect women from violence or the legitimacy of the U.S. as a colonial nation-state, Andrea Smith's incisive and courageous analysis cuts through many of our accepted truths and reveals a new way of knowing rooted in Native women's histories of struggle. More than a call for action, this book provides sophisticated strategies and practical examples of organizing that simultaneously take on state and interpersonal violence. <i>Conquest</i> is a must-read not only for those concerned with violence against women and Native sovereignty, but also for antiracist, reproductive rights, environmental justice, antiprison, immigrant rights, and antiwar activists."&nbsp; (Julia Sudbury editor of <i>Global Lockdown: Race Gender and the Prison-Industrial Complex</i>)<br><br>"Give thanks for the very great honor of listening to Andrea Smith. This book will burn a hole right through your mind with its accurate analysis and the concise compilation of information that makes it the first of its kind. <i>Conquest</i> is not only instructive, it is healing. I want every Indian I know to read it."&nbsp; (Chrystos, artist, poet, and activist)<br><br>"<i>Conquest</i> radically rethinks the historical scope and dimensionality of 'sexual violence,' a historical vector of bodily domination that is too often reduced to universalizing&#x2014;hence racist&#x2014;narratives of gendered oppression and resistance. Offering a breathtaking genealogy of white supremacist genocide and colonization in North America, this book provides a theoretical model that speaks urgently to a broad continuum of political and intellectual traditions. In this incisive and stunningly comprehensive work, we learn how the proliferation of sexual violence as a normalized feature of modern Euro-American patriarchies is inseparable from violence against Indigenous women, and women of color. In <i>Conquest</i>, Andrea Smith has presented us with an epochal challenge, one that should productively disrupt and perhaps transform our visions of liberation and radical freedom."&nbsp; (Dylan Rodr�guez, University of California, Riverside)<br><br>"<i>Conquest</i> is not for those who flinch from an honest examination of white supremacist history, or who shy away from today's controversies in the reproductive health and anti-violence movements. This book is a tough, thoughtful, and passionate analysis of the colonization of America and the resistance of Indigenous women. Andrea Smith is one of this country's premiere intellectuals and a good old-fashioned organizer&#x2014;a rare combination that illuminates her praxis and gift to social justice movement building in the 21st century."&nbsp;<br> (Loretta Ross coauthor of <i>Undivided Rights: Women of Color Organize for Reproductive Justice</i>)</p><h2>Our Longest Days: A People&#39;s History of the Second World War</h2><p>For six years the people of Britain endured bombs and the threat of invasion, and more than 140,000 civilians were killed or seriously wounded.

An adolescent during the German revolutions that followed World War I, he was also a recent �migr� to the United States during the 1930s Great Depression, when the unemployed groups in which he participated were among the most dynamic manifestations of social unrest. Three biographical themes receive special attention the self-taught nature of left-wing activity, Mattick&#x2019;s experiences with publishing, and the nexus of men, politics, and friendship. Mattick found a wide audience during the 1960s because of his emphasis on the economy&#x2019;s dysfunctional aspects and his advocacy of workplace councils a popularity mirrored in the cyclical nature of the global economy.</p><p>Gary Roth is a Lecturer at Rutgers University-Newark and co-author (with Anne Lopes) of <i>Men&#x2019;s Feminism: August Bebel and the German Socialist Movement</i> (Humanity Books, 2000)<br><br>"Just as all good biographies transcend their immediate subject matter and illuminate more enduring truths, so too does Roth's recounting of Mattick's life disclose much about the biases and prejudices within intellectual and political circles on the left, both then and now. [...] <i>Marxism in a Lost Century</i> illuminates as much about ourselves and the world within which left intellectuals circulate today as it does about the world of this remarkable Marxist thinker." - Thom Workman (University of New Brunswick), in <i>Marx and Philosophy Review of Books</i>, 23 July 2016 "Gary Roths biographische Studie uber Paul Mattick basiert wesentlich auf dem umfangreichen, im Amsterdamer Institut fur Sozialgeschichte (IISG) aufbewahrten Nachlass, insbesondere auf der uberlieferten Korrespondenz, die nahezu 2000 Briefe umfasst; auerdem nutzte Roth die Gelegenheit zur Befragung von Zeitzeugen, insbesondere Matticks zweiter Frau Ilse Mattick und den Sohn Paul Mattick Jr., der auch die letzte Schrift seines Vaters "Marxism. Last Refuge of the Bourgoisie?" 1983, zwei Jahre nach dem Tod des Autors 1981 posthum herausbrachte (wahrend eine deutsche Ausgabe leider nach wie vor aussteht).

It tells us a lot about what life was like at various times for working people in both Germany and the United States. The book is worth reading for that alone." - In: Socialist Standard, February 2016 "Gary Roth's <i>Marxism in a Lost Century </i> provides a vivid and fascinating account of the life of Paul Mattick, and in so doing presents a history of the twentieth-century left from the perspective of one of its underappreciated protagonists.

This is his story, recollected in later years, of his life as a slave and as a free man. The book provides firsthand details about slavery, the war, and Sherman&#39;s march. 24 illustrations.</p><p>Born into slavery on a Tennessee plantation, John McCline escaped from bondage, worked for the Union Army in the Civil War, and eventually found a new life in the American West. Slavery in the Clover Bottoms is his own story, recollected in later years, of his life as a slave and as a free man. McCline&#39;s memoirs, completed in the 1920s and now published for the first time, vividly describe the James Hoggatt plantation in Davidson County: the work and routine of slaves; their religious, family, and social life; the behavior of the overseers; and the atmosphere of violence under Mrs. Hoggatt&#39;s omnipresent whip. McCline tells of how he worked with livestock, a boy doing a man&#39;s job, until he ran away with the Thirteenth Infantry of Michigan late in 1862, when he was little more than ten years old. For the next two-and-a-half years, young John worked as a teamster and officers&#39; servant, and during that time he witnessed some of the Civil War&#39;s most famous battles - such as Murfreesboro, Chickamauga Creek, and Lookout Mountain - as well as Sherman&#39;s march through Georgia. Slavery in the Clover Bottoms joins an important body of newly published slave narratives. Its compelling story spans a continent and tells us much about relationships between the races in the middle and late nineteenth century.Jan Furman is professor of early American literature and director of the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program at the University of Michigan-Flint. She is the editor of Slavery in the Clover Bottoms: John McCline&#39;s Narrative of His Life in Slavery and during the Civil War and Song of Solomon: A Casebook.

For the unbeliever, it presents a profound picture of who Jesus really is and how much He cares. For the believer, it is an extraordinary challenge to walk in the fullness of everything God has in store for His Beloved children. <br></p><p>For as we enter the twenty-first century, there is a cry that would ring out from Jesus Christ of Nazareth, as He who neither slumbers nor sleeps, walks even today through the streets of London, Rome, New York, Beirut, Los Angeles, Delhi, His cheek wet with tears for a lost and fatherless generation neither cognizant of His presence nor caring. <p>But still He walks...unseen...and still He weeps. </p><p>Oh, and how long has He sought you, beloved? How many nights has He stood listening silently waiting in the shadows unseen by you? And as you lift up your tear-stained face to Him, half blinded by the radiance from that most beautiful of countenances, He reaches out His hand to you and His touch lingers on your cheek as He brushes away the tears that flow. And He smiles that most wondrous of smiles. </p><p>'You?' you mouth soundlessly. </p><p>And you hear His tender whisper: I have sought you all your life. Through all the pain, through the loneliness, I have sought you. Each time your heart broke soundlessly with the agony of not belonging, I sought you. Through each rejection, through each hour of despair, I sought you. I was there, loving you. Reaching out to you. It was Me all along. And as your eyelids gently close, as you are engulfed in His tender embrace and the tears fall, somewhere through the sands of time in that netherlalnd betwixt sleeping and waking, you recognise that familiar presence and you too know that He was there. It was He all along.</p>Wendy Alec&#39;s calling to the Body of Christ to work in the area of Creative Evangelism in the media, has been integral in the pioneering and establishing of Europe&#39;s first Christian Television Network, GOD TV. Wendy had originally intended to keep her identity as the &#34;Unknown Prophet&#34; anonymous--hence the lack of an authors name on the front cover. She explains, &#34;I sensed during the writing of the journal that I dare not touch his glory, that these are not my words--this is not my work.&#34; That her identity is revealed here is for reasons of accountability alone.</p><h2>Raintree County (6) (Rediscovered Classics)</h2><p>Throughout a single day in 1892, John Shawnessy recalls the great moments of his life&#x2014;from the love affairs of his youth in Indiana, to the battles of the Civil War, to the politics of the Gilded Age, to his homecoming as schoolteacher, husband, and father. Shawnessy is the epitome of the place and period in which he lives, a rural land of springlike women,&nbsp;shady gamblers, wandering vagabonds,&nbsp;and soapbox orators. Yet here on the banks of the Shawmucky River, which weaves its primitive course through Raintree County,&nbsp;Indiana, he also feels and obeys ancient rhythms. A number-one bestseller when it was first published in 1948, this powerful novel is a compelling vision of 19th-century America with timeless resonance today.</p><p><b>Ross Lockridge, Jr.</b>, was born in 1914 in Bloomington, Indiana.

Reflecting on the paradisiacal world of Raintree County, Indiana, Shawnessy relives the pivotal moments of his life, from his youth to the Civil War to his adult years. Lloyd James does a wonderful job reading this book, providing an excellent narrative and a wide range of voices for the various characters.

Most rely on plant hallucinogens to communicate with otherworldly spirits for guidance and for enhanced perceptions of diseases and the identities of enemies. And most can choose whether to direct their energies for good or for evil purposes, an ability that provoked much hostility among their early observers. Scholarly treatments of shamanism, however, have changed dramatically over the centuries. In this excellent volume, anthropologists Narby (The Cosmic Serpent) and Huxley (Affable Savages) have collected observations about and interviews with shamans from more than 60 missionaries, botanists, anthropologists, ethnographers and psychologists spanning from 1535 to 2000. The contributors convey everything from fear, suspicion and condescension to respect, fascination and adulation. Many contemporary anthropologists lament shamanism's recent popularization and its likely degeneration in global culture. Anthropologist Michael F. Brown writes, "Tribal lore is a supermarket from which [New Age Americans] choose some tidbits while spurning others." As an example of shamanism-as-commodity, British anthropologist Piers Vitebsky cites a dumbed-down version of traditional healing that is part of a compulsory course for schoolchildren in northeast Siberia, where 50 years ago shamans were put to death. On the positive side, ethobotanist Glenn H. Shepard believes that shamans will become the ethnobotanists of the future. This first sweeping study of shamanism is sure to become a classic. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Eye Of The World (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Tour.</p><p>With the sensuous eye and profound sense of history that have made him one of the most acclaimed living novelists, John Berger, author of G., tells the story of a wedding that takes place in a Europe that is approaching the end of the century, a place where everything has changed - and not even the certainties of love are exempt. This is Berger's <i>fin de siecle</i>&nbsp;, a transcendent celebration of passion at the end of our millennium.A blind Greek peddler tells the story of the wedding between a fellow peddler and his bride in a remarkable series of vivid and telling vignettes.

By the author of Woe to Live On, The Ones You Do, Muscle for the Wing, and Under the Bright Lights.</p><p>Five of Daniel Woodrell's eight published novels were selected as <em>New York Times </em>Notable Books of the Year. <em>Tomato Red</em> won the PEN West Award for the Novel in 1999. Woodrell lives in the Ozarks near the Arkansas line with his wife, Katie Estill.Again, Woodrell mines his native Ozarks for artistic and comic inspiration, but this time the lode that produced the dazzling The Ones You Do (1992) turns up as much paste as as it does precious stones. The lure of marijuana as a cash crop provides the premise for the author's fifth novel, a lighthearted tale about a pair of literary brothers who wind up settling an old family score when a drug deal goes awry. As the story opens, narrator Doyle Redmond, a crime novelist, is returning to the Ozarks from California in a Volvo he stole from his wife after she slept with a prominent poet. Back home, Doyle hunkers down with his brother, Smoke, a fellow author whose attention has turned to cultivating a large marijuana crop for a big profit. While helping Smoke harvest the illegal bounty, Doyle engages in an impromptu romance with the daughter of Smoke's girlfriend, a teenage beauty named Niagra Mattux, who has a yen for the silver screen. This brief idyll gives way to violent reality when the dope deal finally goes down and the Redmond brothers are ambushed by a family of local degenerates called the Dollys. Woodrell's extraordinarily deft prose makes for a luscious read, and his unique combination of existential redneck humor and sharp literary barbs proves entertaining. But there's little substance behind the nonstop jokes, a problem that grows more aggravating as the plot winds down into a series of stock action scenes followed by a predictable resolution. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Know Much About the Kings and Queens of England</h2><p>Enhanced with sidebars, a &#34;question-and-answer&#34; section, and colorful illustrations, this picture book offers young readers a factual review of the life and times of some of the most well-known kings and queens of England.</p><p>Do you know which British queen ruled for 63 years?

If you want to grow your own cut flowers, there could be no better guide in the world. The book ties-in with an eight-part five-minute mini-series on Gardeners World in spring 2002. Grow Your Own CUT FLOWERS is for the flower arranger who wants to grow their own flowers, but has never gardened before, and for the gardener who knows how to grow their own flowers, but wants ideas to fill a house with their harvest. It demystifies the world of floristry, giving away all the insiders&#39; tips on sowing seed, conditioning flowers and making simple, but stylish arrangements a tied bunch, a large vase, a table centre and more elaborate party flowers. No alarming terms, complex procedures or slabs of wordy text here Grow Your Own Cut Flowers is written more like a cookery book with recipes than a traditional gardening book. Illustrated with over 250 striking colour photographs by Jonathan Buckley, Grow Your Own Cut Flowers is stylish and inspirational as well as practical and accessible. THE AUTHOR WILL UNDERTAKE TO AMERICANIZE THE TEXT FOR ANY CO-EDITIONS.</p><p>Sarah Raven, writer, cook, broadcaster and teacher, is the expert on all things to grow, cut and eat from your garden. Sarah is a presenter on BBC Gardeners&#39; World, she writes for The Daily Telegraph, Gardens Illustrated, Gardeners&#39; World Magazine, and Domino Magazine (US) and has been a guest on BBC Radio 4&#39;s Woman&#39;s Hour and the Food Programme. Her gardening and cookery books have won her a number of awards including Best Specialist Gardening book for The Cutting Garden and Cookery Book of the Year for Sarah Raven&#39;s Garden Cookbook. Her latest book looks at the vital role Wildflowers play in the British countryside. She also had a well-received TV series (BBC2) in Spring 2012 called &#39;Bees, Butterflies and Blooms&#39; on the crisis of insects and Sarah&#39;s attempts to flower up the nation to hugely increase insect food and habitat supply. Sarah is an inspirational and passionate teacher, running cooking, flower arranging, growing and gardening courses at Perch Hill, her farm in East Sussex, and around the country, since 1999. She is married to the writer Adam Nicolson and has two daughters and three stepsons. They divide their time between Sissinghurst Castle and Perch Hill Farm.Everyone loves cut flowers in the house but many gardeners are loathe to cut flowers from their own gardens for fear of diminishing the dispay outside. Sarah Raven, doyenne of the cutting garden, attempts to dispel that myth in &#34;Grow Your Own Cut Flowers&#34;, showing how the choice of plants grown affects their cutting and reflowering abilities thus getting the best of both worlds. From small town gardens to larger country gardens such as Sarah&#39;s, annuals, biennials and bulbs can be grown in such a way as to provide fresh cut flowers throughout the year. Either interspersed amongst existing borders or grown separately in a cutting garden, beautiful arrangements can be simply made whilst leaving a still colourful border intact. Easy to read, although at times more advanced than necessary for a newcomer, it gives clear instructions on how to grow the best plants, both floral and foliar, from seed, cuttings, bulbs and tubers. Cutting garden designs are included along with the best methods of sowing and aftercare. Comprehensive plant lists follow each plant type with descriptions, roles and uses together with any specific growing requirements. The book ends on examples of flower arranging and their techniques in typical Raven style - original, eclectic, bold and absolutely stunning. Beautifully photographed at Sarah Raven&#39;s house in Perch Hill, Sussex by Jonathan Buckley, the photographs inspire the reader to find out how they too can create such arrangements for themselves. As Sarah says in her introduction, &#34;it is the generous gardener who has the most flowers&#34; and by growing the plants in this book not only will you have a house full of flowers but a garden full too.</p><h2>The Whole-Brain Child</h2><p>The Whole-Brain Child by Daniel J.

They know that a temperature above 98.6 degrees is a fever. They know to clean out a cut so it doesn't get infected. They know which foods are most likely to leave their child wired before bedtime.<br><br>But even the most caring, best-educated parents often lack basic information about their child's brain. Isn't this surprising? Especially when you consider the central role the brain plays in virtually every aspect of a child's life that parents care about: discipline, decision making, self-awareness, school, relationships, and so on. In fact, the brain pretty much determines who we are and what we do. And since the brain itself is significantly shaped by the experiences we offer as parents, knowing about the way the brain changes in response to our parenting can help us to nurture a stronger, more resilient child.<br><br>So we want to introduce you to the whole-brain perspective. We'd like to explain some fundamental concepts about the brain and help you apply your new knowledge in ways that will make parenting easier and more meaningful. We're not saying that raising a whole-brain child will get rid of all the frustrations that come with parenting. But by understanding a few simple and easy-to-master basics about how the brain works, you'll be able to better understand your child, respond more effectively to difficult situations, and build a foundation for social, emotional, and mental health. What you do as a parent matters, and we'll provide you with straightforward, scientifically based ideas that will help you build a strong relationship with your child that can help shape his brain well and give him the best foundation for a healthy and happy life.<br><br>Let us tell you a story that illustrates how useful this information can be for parents.<br><br>Eea Woo Woo<br><br>One day Marianna received a call at work telling her that her two- year-old son, Marco, had been in a car accident with his babysitter. Marco was fine, but the babysitter, who was driving, had been taken to the hospital in an ambulance.<br><br>Marianna, a principal at an elementary school, frantically rushed to the scene of the accident, where she was told that the babysitter had experienced an epileptic seizure while driving. Marianna found a firefighter unsuccessfully attempting to console her toddler. She took Marco in her arms, and he immediately began to calm down as she comforted him.<br><br>As soon as he stopped crying, Marco began telling Marianna what had happened. Using his two-year-old language, which only his parents and babysitter would be able to understand, Marco continually repeated the phrase "Eea woo woo." "Eea" is his word for "Sophia," the name of his beloved babysitter, and "woo woo" refers to his version of the siren on a fire truck (or in this case, an ambulance). By repeatedly telling his mother "Eea woo woo," Marco was focusing on the detail of the story that mattered most to him: Sophia had been taken away from him.<br><br>In a situation like this, many of us would be tempted to assure Marco that Sophia would be fine, then immediately focus on something else to get the child's mind off the situation: "Let's go get some ice cream!" In the days that followed, many parents would try to avoid upsetting their child by not discussing the accident. The problem with the "let's go get some ice cream" approach is that it leaves the child confused about what happened and why. He is still full of big and scary emotions, but he isn't allowed (or helped) to deal with them in an effective way.<br><br>Marianna didn't make that mistake. She had taken Tina's classes on parenting and the brain, and she immediately put what she knew to good use. That night and over the next week, when Marco's mind continually brought him back to the car crash, Marianna helped him retell the story over and over again. She'd say, "Yes, you and Sophia were in an accident, weren't you?" At this point, Marco would stretch out his arms and shake them, imitating Sophia's seizure. Marianna would continue, "Yes, Sophia had a seizure and started shaking, and the car crashed, didn't it?" Marco's next statement was, of course, the familiar "Eea woo woo," to which Marianna would respond, "That's right. The woo woo came and took Sophia to the doctor. And now she's all better. Remember when we went to see her yesterday? She's doing just fine, isn't she?"<br><br>In allowing Marco to repeatedly retell the story, Marianna was helping him understand what had happened so he could begin to deal with it emotionally. Since she knew the importance of helping her son's brain process the frightening experience, she helped him tell and retell the events so that he could process his fear and go on with his daily routines in a healthy and balanced way. Over the next few days, Marco brought up the accident less and less, until it became just another of his life experiences-albeit an important one.<br><br>As you read the following pages, you'll learn specifics about why Marianna responded as she did, and why, both practically and neurologically, it was so helpful to her son. You'll be able to apply your new knowledge about the brain in numerous ways that make parenting your own child more manageable and meaningful.<br><br>The concept at the heart of Marianna's response, and of this book, is integration. A clear understanding of integration will give you the power to completely transform the way you think about parenting your kids. It can help you enjoy them more and better prepare them to live emotionally rich and rewarding lives.<br><br>What Is Integration and Why Does It Matter?<br><br>Most of us don't think about the fact that our brain has many different parts with different jobs. For example, you have a left side of the brain that helps you think logically and organize thoughts into sentences, and a right side that helps you experience emotions and read nonverbal cues. You also have a "reptile brain" that allows you to act instinctually and make split-second survival decisions, and a "mammal brain" that leads you toward connection and relationships. One part of your brain is devoted to dealing with memory; another to making moral and ethical decisions. It's almost as if your brain has multiple personalities-some rational, some irrational; some reflective, some reactive. No wonder we can seem like different people at different times!<br><br>The key to thriving is to help these parts work well together-to integrate them. Integration takes the distinct parts of your brain and helps them work together as a whole. It's similar to what happens in the body, which has different organs to perform different jobs: the lungs breathe air, the heart pumps blood, the stomach digests food. For the body to be healthy, these organs all need to be integrated. In other words, they each need to do their individual job while also working together as a whole. Integration is simply that: linking different elements together to make a well-functioning whole. Just as with the healthy functioning of the body, your brain can't perform at its best unless its different parts work together in a coordinated and balanced way. That's what integration does: it coordinates and balances the separate regions of the brain that it links together. It's easy to see when our kids aren't integrated-they become overwhelmed by their emotions, confused and chaotic. They can't respond calmly and capably to the situation at hand. Tantrums, meltdowns, aggression, and most of the other challenging experiences of parenting-and life-are a result of a loss of integration, also known as dis-integration.<br><br>We want to help our children become better integrated so they can use their whole brain in a coordinated way. For example, we want them to be horizontally integrated, so that their left-brain logic can work well with their right-brain emotion. We also want them to be vertically integrated, so that the physically higher parts of their brain, which let them thoughtfully consider their actions, work well with the lower parts, which are more concerned with instinct, gut reactions, and survival.<br><br>The way integration actually takes place is fascinating, and it's something that most people aren't aware of. In recent years, scientists have developed brain-scanning technology that allows researchers to study the brain in ways that were never before possible. This new technology has confirmed much of what we previously believed about the brain. However, one of the surprises that has shaken the very foundations of neuroscience is the discovery that the brain is actually "plastic," or moldable. This means that the brain physically changes throughout the course of our lives, not just in childhood, as we had previously assumed.<br><br>What molds our brain? Experience. Even into old age, our experiences actually change the physical structure of the brain. When we undergo an experience, our brain cells-called neurons-become active, or "fire." The brain has one hundred billion neurons, each with an average of ten thousand connections to other neurons. The ways in which particular circuits in the brain are activated determines the nature of our mental activity, ranging from perceiving sights or sounds to more abstract thought and reasoning. When neurons fire together, they grow new connections between them. Over time, the connections that result from firing lead to "rewiring" in the brain. This is incredibly exciting news. It means that we aren't held captive for the rest of our lives by the way our brain works at this moment-we can actually rewire it so that we can be healthier and happier. This is true not only for children and adolescents, but also for each of us across the life span.<br><br>Right now, your child's brain is constantly being wired and rewired, and the experiences you provide will go a long way toward determining the structure of her brain. No pressure, right? Don't worry, though. Nature has provided that the basic architecture of the brain will develop well given proper food, sleep, and stimulation. Genes, of course, play a large role in how people turn out, especially in terms of temperament. But findings from various areas in developmental psychology suggest that everything that happens to us-the music we hear, the people we love, the books we read, the kind of discipline we receive, the emotions we feel-profoundly affects the way our brain develops. In other words, on top of our basic brain architecture and our inborn temperament, parents have much they can do to provide the kinds of experiences that will help develop a resilient, well- integrated brain. This book will show you how to use everyday experiences to help your child's brain become more and more integrated.<br><br>For example, children whose parents talk with them about their experiences tend to have better access to the memories of those experiences. Parents who speak with their children about their feelings have children who develop emotional intelligence and can understand their own and other people's feelings more fully. Shy children whose parents nurture a sense of courage by offering supportive explorations of the world tend to lose their behavioral inhibition, while those who are excessively protected or insensitively thrust into anxiety-provoking experiences without support tend to maintain their shyness.<br><br>There is a whole field of the science of child development and attachment backing up this view-and the new findings in the field of neuroplasticity support the perspective that parents can directly shape the unfolding growth of their child's brain according to what experiences they offer. For example, hours of screen time-playing video games, watching television, texting-will wire the brain in certain ways. Educational activities, sports, and music will wire it in other ways. Spending time with family and friends and learning about relationships, especially with face-to-face interactions, will wire it in yet other ways. Everything that happens to us affects the way the brain develops.<br><br>This wire-and-rewire process is what integration is all about: giving our children experiences to create connections between different parts of the brain. When these parts collaborate, they create and reinforce the integrative fibers that link different parts of the brain. As a result, they are connected in more powerful ways and can work together even more harmoniously. Just as individual singers in a choir can weave their distinct voices into a harmony that would be impossible for any one person to create, an integrated brain is capable of doing much more than its individual parts could accomplish alone.<br><br>That's what we want to do for each of our kids: help their brain become more integrated so they can use their mental resources to full capacity. This is exactly what Marianna did for Marco. When she helped him retell the story over and over again ("Eea woo woo"), she defused the scary and traumatic emotions in his right brain so that they didn't rule him. She did so by bringing in factual details and logic from his left brain-which, at two years old, is just beginning to develop-so that he could deal with the accident in a way that made sense to him.<br><br>If his mother hadn't helped him tell and understand the story, Marco's fears would have been left unresolved and could have surfaced in other ways. He might have developed a phobia about riding in cars or being separated from his parents, or his right brain might have raged out of control in other ways, causing him to tantrum frequently. Instead, by telling the story with Marco, Marianna helped focus his attention both on the actual details of the accident and on his emotions, which allowed him to use both the left and right sides of his brain together, literally strengthening their connection. (We'll explain this particular concept much more fully in chapter 2.) By helping him become better integrated, he could return to being a normal, developing two-year-old rather than dwelling on the fear and distress he had experienced.<br><br>Let's look at another example. Now that you and your siblings are adults, do you still fight over who gets to push the button for the elevator? Of course not. (Well, we hope not.) But do your kids squabble and bicker over this kind of issue? If they're typical kids, they do.<br><br>The reason behind this difference brings us back to the brain and integration. Sibling rivalry is like so many other issues that make parenting difficult-tantrums, disobedience, homework battles, discipline matters, and so on. As we'll explain in the coming chapters, these everyday parenting challenges result from a lack of integration within your child's brain. The reason her brain isn't always capable of integration is simple: it hasn't had time to develop. In fact, it's got a long way to go, since a person's brain isn't considered fully developed until she reaches her mid-twenties.<br><br>So that's the bad news: you have to wait for your child's brain to develop. That's right. No matter how brilliant you think your preschooler is, she does not have the brain of a ten-year-old, and won't for several years. The rate of brain maturation is largely influenced by the genes we inherit. But the degree of integration may be exactly what we can influence in our day-to-day parenting.</p><h2>Three Pebbles and A Song</h2><p><p>Snow is coming! Mama tells Moses to gather supplies-quick, quick, quick! But as Moses makes his way through the forest, he hears a whistle-y song, and an inspiration to play and dance. Will he be able to share these not-so-practical delights with his practical-minded family?</p></p><p>S. D. Schindler lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.PreSchool-Grade 3-A delightful tale about self-expression and how individuals can contribute to their family's well-being in different but equally important ways. Moses, a young mouse, fails miserably at collecting the tangible things that are necessary for winter survival. He much prefers twirling and skittering like the fallen leaves, humming and whistling like the wind through the corn stalks, and tossing and catching tiny rocks. Although he does not forage for rags, corn, crumbs, and raisins like the rest of his family, Moses manages to accumulate a dance, a song, and three shiny pebbles (just right for juggling) that help to keep everyone entertained through the long cold days. This tale is similar in theme and characters to Leo Lionni's Frederick (Knopf, 1967). The plot is well developed, the text contains many descriptive words, and emergent readers will appreciate the repetitive and predictable language. Done in gouache, watercolors, inks, pastels, and chalk, Schindler's painterly artwork captures perfectly the chill of the coming winter and the warmth of a happy home. The spreads show mice clad in lace-collared calico dresses and pants held up by suspenders, and their expressive faces reflect the nuances of the story.

Most Iraqis were barred from entering the Emerald City for fear they would blow it up.<br><br> Drawing on hundreds of interviews and internal documents, Chandrasekaran tells the story of the people and ideas that inhabited the Green Zone during the occupation, from the imperial viceroy L. Paul Bremer III to the fleet of twentysomethings hired to implement the idea that Americans could build a Jeffersonian democracy in an embattled Middle Eastern country.<br><br> In the vacuum of postwar planning, Bremer ignores what Iraqis tell him they want or need and instead pursues irrelevant neoconservative solutions&#x2014;a flat tax, a sell-off of Iraqi government assets, and an end to food rationing. His underlings spend their days drawing up pie-in-the-sky policies, among them a new traffic code and a law protecting microchip designs, instead of rebuilding looted buildings and restoring electricity production. His almost comic initiatives anger the locals and help fuel the insurgency.<br><br> Chandrasekaran details Bernard Kerik&#x2019;s ludicrous attempt to train the Iraqi police and brings to light lesser known but typical travesties: the case of the twenty-four-year-old who had never worked in finance put in charge of reestablishing Baghdad&#x2019;s stock exchange; a contractor with no previous experience paid millions to guard a closed airport; a State Department employee forced to bribe Americans to enlist their help in preventing Iraqi weapons scientists from defecting to Iran; Americans willing to serve in Iraq screened by White House officials for their views on <i>Roe v. Wade; </i>people<i> </i>with prior expertise in the Middle East excluded in favor of lesser-qualified Republican Party loyalists. Finally, he describes Bremer&#x2019;s ignominious departure in 2004, fleeing secretly in a helicopter two days ahead of schedule.<br><br> This is a startling portrait of an Oz-like place where a vital aspect of our government&#x2019;s folly in Iraq played out. It is a book certain to be talked about for years to come.</p><p>Rajiv Chandrasekaran is an assistant managing editor of <i>The Washington Post, </i>where he has worked since 1994. He previously served the <i>Post </i>as a bureau chief in Baghdad, Cairo, and Southeast Asia, and as a correspondent covering the war in Afghanistan.

The fare was always American, often with a Southern flavor. A buffet featured grits, cornbread, and a bottomless barrel of pork: sausage for breakfast, hot dogs for lunch, pork chops for dinner. There were bacon cheeseburgers, grilled- cheese-and-bacon sandwiches, and bacon omelets. Hundreds of Iraqi secretaries and translators who worked for the occupation authority had to eat in the dining hall. Most of them were Muslims, and many were offended by the presence of pork. But the American contractors running the kitchen kept serving it. The cafeteria was all about meeting American needs for high-calorie, high-fat comfort food.<br><br>None of the succulent tomatoes or the crisp cucumbers grown in Iraq made it into the salad bar. U.S. government regulations dictated that everything, even the water in which hot dogs were boiled, be shipped in from approved suppliers in other nations. Milk and bread were trucked in from Kuwait, as were tinned peas and carrots. The breakfast cereal was flown in from the United States&#x2014;made-in-the-USA Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes at the breakfast table helped boost morale.<br><br>When the Americans had arrived, there was no cafeteria in the palace. Saddam Hussein had feasted in an ornate private dining room and his servants had eaten in small kitchenettes. The engineers assigned to transform the palace into the seat of the American occupation chose a marble-floored conference room the size of a gymnasium to serve as the mess hall. Halliburton, the defense contractor hired to run the palace, brought in dozens of tables, hundreds of stacking chairs, and a score of glass-covered buffets. Seven days a week, the Americans ate under Saddam&#x2019;s crystal chandeliers.<br><br>Red and white linens covered the tables. Diners sat on chairs with maroon cushions. A pleated skirt decorated the salad bar and the dessert table, which was piled high with cakes and cookies. The floor was polished after every meal.<br><br>A mural of the World Trade Center adorned one of the entrances. The Twin Towers were framed within the outstretched wings of a bald eagle. Each branch of the U.S. military&#x2014;the army, air force, marines, and navy&#x2014;had its seal on a different corner of the mural. In the middle were the logos of the New York City Police and Fire departments, and atop the towers were the words thank god for the coalition forces &amp; freedom fighters at home and abroad.<br><br>At another of the three entrances was a bulletin board with posted notices, including<br><br>those that read, bible study&#x2014;wednesdays at 7 p.m.<br><br>go running with the hash house harriers!<br><br>feeling stressed? come visit us at the combat stress clinic.<br><br>for sale: like-new hunting knife.<br><br>lost camera. reward offered.<br><br>The kitchen, which had once prepared gourmet meals for Saddam, had been converted into an institutional food processing center, with a giant deep fryer and bathtub-size mixing bowls. Halliburton had hired dozens of Pakistanis and Indians to cook and serve and clean, but no Iraqis. Nobody ever explained why, but everyone knew. They could poison the food.<br><br>The Pakistanis and the Indians wore white button-down shirts with black vests, black bow ties, and white paper hats. The Kuwaiti subcontractor who kept their passports and exacted a meaty profit margin off each worker also dinned into them American lingo. When I asked one of the Indians for French fries, he snapped: &#x201c;We have no French fries here, sir. Only freedom fries.&#x201d;<br><br>The seating was as tribal as that at a high school cafeteria. The Iraqi support staffers kept to themselves. They loaded their lunch trays with enough calories for three meals. Between mouthfuls, they mocked their American bosses with impunity. So few Americans in the palace spoke Arabic fluently that those who did could have fit around one table, with room to spare.<br><br>Soldiers, private contractors, and mercenaries also segregated themselves. So did the representatives of the &#x201c;coalition of the willing&#x201d;&#x2014;the Brits, the Aussies, the Poles, the Spaniards, and the Italians. The American civilians who worked for the occupation government had their own cliques: the big-shot political appointees, the twentysomethings fresh out of college, the old hands who had arrived in Baghdad in the first weeks of occupation. In conversation at their tables, they observed an unspoken protocol. It was always appropriate to praise &#x201c;the mission&#x201d;&#x2014;the Bush administration&#x2019;s campaign to transform Iraq into a peaceful, modern, secular democracy where everyone, regardless of sect or ethnicity, would get along. Tirades about how Saddam had ruined the country and descriptions of how you were going to resuscitate it were also fine. But unless you knew someone really, really well, you didn&#x2019;t question American policy over a meal.<br><br>If you had a complaint about the cafeteria, Michael Colewas the man to see. He was Halliburton&#x2019;s &#x201c;customer-service liaison,&#x201d; and he could explain why the salad bar didn&#x2019;t have Iraqi produce or why pork kept appearing on the menu. If you wanted to request a different type of breakfast cereal, he&#x2019;d listen. Cole didn&#x2019;t have the weathered look of a war-zone concierge. He was a rail-thin twenty-two- year-old whose forehead was dotted with pimples.<br><br>He had been out of college for less than a year and was working as a junior aide to a Republican congressman from Virginia when a Halliburton vice president overheard him talking to friends in an Arlington bar about his dealings with irate constituents. She was so impressed that she introduced herself. If she needed someone to work as a valet in Baghdad, he joked, he&#x2019;d be happy to volunteer. Three weeks later, Halliburton offered him a job. Then they asked for his r�sum�.<br><br>Cole never ate pork products in the mess hall. He knew many of the servers were Pakistani Muslims and he felt terrible that they had to handle food they deemed offensive. He was rewarded for his expression of respect with invitations to the Dickensian trailer park where the kitchen staff lived. They didn&#x2019;t have to abide by American rules governing food procurement. Their kitchens were filled with local produce, and they cooked spicy curries that were better than anything Cole found in the cafeteria. He thought of proposing an Indian- Pakistani food night at the mess hall, but then remembered that the palace didn&#x2019;t do ethnic fare. &#x201c;The cooking had to make people feel like they were back at home,&#x201d; he said. And home, in this case, was presumed to be somewhere south of the Mason-Dixon Line.<br><br>Cole&#x2019;s mission was to keep the air in the bubble, to ensure that the Americans who had left home to work for the occupation administration felt comfortable. Food was part of it. But so were movies, mattresses, and laundry service. If he was asked for something, Cole tried to get it, whether he thought it important or not. &#x201c;Yes, sir. We&#x2019;ll look into that,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say. Or, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry you&#x2019;re so upset. We&#x2019;ll try to fix it as soon as possible.&#x201d;<br><br>The palace was the headquarters of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the American occupation administration in Iraq. From April 2003 to June 2004, the CPA ran Iraq&#x2019;s government&#x2014;it enacted laws, printed currency, collected taxes, deployed police, and spent oil revenue. At its height, the CPA had more than 1,500 employees in Baghdad, most of them American. They were a motley bunch: businessmen who were active in the Republican Party, retirees who wanted one last taste of adventure, diplomats who had studied Iraq for years, recent college graduates who had never had a full-time job, government employees who wanted the 25 percent salary bonus paid for working in a war zone. The CPA was headed by America&#x2019;s viceroy in Iraq, Lewis Paul Bremer III, who always wore a blue suit and tan combat boots, even on those summer days when Iraqis drooped in the heat. He was surrounded by burly, submachine gun&#x2013;toting bodyguards everywhere he went, even to the bathroom in the palace.<br><br>The palace was Versailles on the Tigris. Constructed of sandstone and marble, it had wide hallways, soaring columns, and spiral staircases. Massive bronze busts of Saddam in an Arab warrior&#x2019;s headdress looked down from the four corners of the roof. The cafeteria was on the south side, next to a chapel with a billboard-size mural of a Scud missile arcing into the sky. In the northern wing was an enormous ballroom with a balcony overlooking the dance floor. The heart of the palace was a giant marble rotunda with a turquoise dome. After the Americans arrived, the entire place took on the slapdash appearance of a start-up company. Dell computers sat atop ornate wooden desks partitioned by fabric-covered cubicle dividers. Data cables snaked along the gilded moldings. Erasable whiteboards hung from the mirrored walls.<br><br>A row of portable toilets lined the rear driveway. The palace, designed as a showplace for Saddam to meet visiting dignitaries, lacked enough commodes for hundreds of occupants. Dormitory space was also in short supply. Most new arrivals had to sleep on bunk beds in the chapel, a room that came to resemble a World War II field hospital.<br><br>Appearances aside, the same rules applied in the palace asin any government building in Washington. Everyone wore an identification badge. Decorum was enforced in the high-ceilinged halls. I remember hearing a soldier admonish a staffer hustling to a meeting: &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, you must not run in the corridor.&#x201d;<br><br>Whatever could be outsourced was.

He has lived with his wife in Italy for more than 20 years, and he teaches at the English School in Rome.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by by Ron Charles During the pause between world wars, a Jewish businessman and his new wife commissioned a startlingly modern house for themselves in Czechoslovakia. They hired the German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and gave him free rein to design an avant-garde structure that looks like a Mondrian painting in three dimensions: a long, low building of dramatic straight lines, marked by a large room with floor-to-ceiling glass walls. Unbelievably, this elegant house survived the dismemberment of the First Republic of Czechoslovakia, German bombing, Soviet invasion and the natural forces that conspire against a neglected building. The Villa Tugendhat, which has been a public museum since the mid-1990s, remains a masterpiece of minimalist architecture, and now it's the evocative setting for a stirring new novel that almost won this year's Booker Prize. The author, Simon Mawer, moves through six decades of European history, much of it unspeakably tragic, using the glass house as a window on the hopes and fears of its various inhabitants and the conflicts that rip Europe apart. Pianists and Nazis, doctors and servants, everyone is drawn to the living room's extraordinary vista and feels aroused by the promise of such clarity: This is "a place of balance and reason," Mawer writes, "an ageless place held in a rectilinear frame that handles light like a substance and volume like a tangible material and denies the very existence of time." But the architecture proves purer than the human spirit. Again and again, the residents of this glass house find they can't tolerate the light of full disclosure even as they're attracted to it. Mawer has recast the original owner of the house as a sophisticated automobile magnate named Viktor Landauer. An idealist determined to throw off the trappings of religion, aristocracy and nationalism, he's prone to grand slogans about the future and eager to enlist a mesmerizing young architect from Germany, "a poet of space and structure" who shares his sense of the exciting new world. "Ever since Man came out of the cave he has been building caves around him," Mies tells Viktor. "But I wish to take Man out of the cave and float him in the air. I wish to give him a glass space to inhabit." Viktor finds these ideas captivating, no matter how expensive. This is the "dream that went with the spirit of a brand new country in which they found themselves," he thinks, "a state in which being Czech or German or Jew would not matter, in which democracy would prevail and art and science would combine to bring happiness to all people." Mawer spreads the dramatic irony pretty thick here in the first part of the novel. With trouble already smoldering in Germany, two or three toasts to the gloriously peaceful future would have been plenty. Fortunately, he's more interesting and subtle in bringing out the small, private ways in which these characters fail to live up to their ideals. The Landauers' glass house has the effect "of liberating people from the strictures and conventions of the ordinary, of making them transparent," but that turns out to be a Foucauldian nightmare, more problematic than anyone realizes. Honestly, could you live in a place "where there will be no secrets"? While the architect insists his clients don't need walls, Viktor discovers that, in fact, parts of his life must remain cloistered. His wife, Liesel, announces to a curious public that "living inside a work of art is an experience of sublime delight," but she doesn't know what Viktor is doing in the back streets of Vienna. And soon their happy marriage becomes a kind of stage performance, free for all to see but deeply deceptive. "The Glass Room" works so effectively because Mawer embeds these provocative aesthetic and moral issues in a war-torn adventure story that's eerily erotic and tremendously exciting. No matter how transparent and luminescent their architecture, the Landauers still ride the murky currents of history. The house endures, "plain, balanced, perfect; and indifferent," but the family is swept aside by the battles that tear through Czechoslovakia. In the second half of the novel, Mawer rotates several different casts through the Landauers' home, using the glass room to examine people entirely unlike the original owners. In one of the most chilling sections, a German geneticist sets up his laboratory in the abandoned house and hopes the light of science will confirm Hitler's racial propaganda. His work is peaceful -- lots of careful measuring and photographing, "the cool gaze of scientific objectivity" -- but that only renders the whole enterprise more obscene. And like everyone else who lives in this glass room, he finds that such bright exposure makes him more determined to conceal the darkest aspects of his life. Mawer, an Englishman living in Italy, has written this novel as though it were a translation, endowing his prose with a patina of Old World formality that sounds all the more romantic. He claims he doesn't know Czech or German, but his characters speak both fluently, and his attention to foreign languages enriches every episode. These are, after all, people caught in the violent confluence of political upheaval; choosing to speak Czech or German or English becomes a matter of resistance or collusion or hope. And at crucial moments, certain foreign words illuminate the story in poignant ways, as when a Czech resident of the Landauers' old house realizes that "the word he used for room, pokoj, can also mean peace, tranquillity, quiet. So when he said 'the glass room' he was also saying 'the glass tranquillity.' " In chapter after chapter, era after era, the house miraculously continues, working as a talisman, "its spirit of transparency percolating the human beings who stand within it, rendering them as translucent as the glass itself." Like this gorgeous novel, that's an irresistible promise, though far more troubling than it first appears. charlesr@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Keating delivers this story&#39;s differing points of view, making it easy to distinguish between the equine observer and the humans in his world. All too soon, Joey leaves his loving farm boy, Albert, to soldier through the horrors of WWI. Like the classic horse hero Black Beauty, Joey has a string of human owners. Keating characterizes each with credible emotions, accents, and age qualities. Through his portrayals, listeners understand the uniqueness of Joey&#39;s masters, whether Welsh or German. Hearing their distinctly different stories and voices enables listeners to see the humans&#39; commonality. Each one hates war and bears love and admiration for the courage of this noble steed. S.W.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Humans, the Harvard University entomologist Edward O. Wilson has observed, have an innate--or at least extremely ancient--connection to the natural world, and our continued divorce from it has led to the loss of not only "a vast intellectual legacy born of intimacy" with nature, but also our very sanity. In <i>The Diversity of Life</i>, Wilson takes a sweeping view of our planet's natural richness, remarking on what on the surface seems a paradox: "almost all the species that ever lived are extinct, and yet more are alive today than at any time in the past." (Wilson's elegant explanation is a scientific education in itself.) This great variety of species is, of course, threatened by habitat destruction, global climate change, and a host of other forces, and Wilson revisits his oft-stated call for the protection of wilderness and undeveloped land, noting that "wilderness has virtue unto itself and needs no extraneous justification." We should, he continues, regard every species, "every scrap of biodiversity," as precious and irreplaceable, without attempting to quantify that regard with utilitarian measures such as "bio-economics." In short, Wilson offers with this book a simple, workable environmental ethic that extends the work of Aldo Leopold and other conservationists. A remarkably productive and influential scientist, Wilson is also a fine writer, and his survey of biodiversity makes for welcome and instructive reading. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Edward O. Wilson is widely recognized as one of the world&#x2019;s preeminent biologists and naturalists.

He was a painter, an etcher, a student of</p><p>James McNeill Whistler, and a disciple of Edgar Degas. Young Sickert</p><p>was himself a work of art: slender, with a strong upper body from swimming,</p><p>a perfectly angled nose and jaw, thick wavy blond hair, and blue</p><p>eyes that were as inscrutable and penetrating as his secret thoughts and</p><p>piercing mind. One might almost have called him pretty, except for his</p><p>mouth, which could narrow into a hard, cruel line. His precise height is</p><p>unknown, but a friend of his described him as a little above average. Photographs</p><p>and several items of clothing donated to the Tate Gallery</p><p>Archive in the 1980s suggest he was probably five foot eight or nine.</p><p>Sickert was fluent in German, English, French, and Italian. He knew</p><p>Latin well enough to teach it to friends, and he was well acquainted with</p><p>Danish and Greek and possibly knew a smattering of Spanish and Portuguese.</p><p>He was said to read the classics in their original languages, but</p><p>he didn&#x2019;t always finish a book once he started it. It wasn&#x2019;t uncommon to</p><p>find dozens of novels strewn about, opened to the last page that had</p><p>snagged his interest. Mostly, Sickert was addicted to newspapers,</p><p>tabloids, and journals.</p><p>Until his death in 1942, his studios and studies looked like a recycling</p><p>center for just about every bit of newsprint to roll off the European</p><p>P A T R I C I A C O R N W E L L</p><p>[ 2 ]</p><p>presses. One might ask how any hard-working person could find time to</p><p>go through four, five, six, ten newspapers a day, but Sickert had a</p><p>method. He didn&#x2019;t bother with what didn&#x2019;t interest him, whether it was</p><p>politics, economics, world affairs, wars, or people. Nothing mattered to</p><p>Sickert unless it somehow affected Sickert.</p><p>He usually preferred to read about the latest entertainment to come</p><p>to town, to scrutinize art critiques, to turn quickly to any story about</p><p>crime, and to search for his own name if there was any reason it might</p><p>be in print on a given day. He was fond of letters to the editor, especially</p><p>ones he wrote and signed with a pseudonym. Sickert relished knowing</p><p>what other people were doing, especially in the privacy of their own notalways-</p><p>so-tidy Victorian lives. &#x201c;Write, write, write!&#x201d; he would beg his</p><p>friends. &#x201c;Tell me in detail all sorts of things, things that have amused you</p><p>and how and when and where, and all sorts of gossip about every one.&#x201d;</p><p>Sickert despised the upper class, but he was a star stalker. He somehow</p><p>managed to hobnob with the major celebrities of the day: Henry Irving</p><p>and Ellen Terry, Aubrey Beardsley, Henry James, Max Beerbohm,</p><p>Oscar Wilde, Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Rodin, Andr� Gide, �douard Dujardin,</p><p>Proust, Members of Parliament.

By the time of Whistler&#x2019;s</p><p>engagement their friendship had cooled, but Sickert could not have been</p><p>prepared for what must have seemed a shockingly unexpected and complete</p><p>abandonment by the Master he idolized, envied, and hated.</p><p>Whistler and his new bride planned to honeymoon and travel the rest of</p><p>the year in France, where they hoped to reside permanently.</p><p>The anticipated connubial bliss of the flamboyant artistic genius and</p><p>egocentric James McNeill Whistler must have been disconcerting to his</p><p>former errand boy&#x2013;apprentice. One of Sickert&#x2019;s many roles was the irresistible</p><p>womanizer, but offstage he was nothing of the sort. Sickert was</p><p>dependent on women and loathed them.

Women were a dangerous reminder of an infuriating and</p><p>humiliating secret that Sickert carried not only to the grave but beyond</p><p>it, because cremated bodies reveal no tales of the flesh, even if they are</p><p>exhumed.

An Asian tycoon buys a single specimen for $150,000. Meanwhile, a pet detective chases smugglers through the streets of New York. Delving into an outlandish realm of obsession, paranoia, and criminality, <i>The Dragon Behind the Glass</i> tells the story of a fish like none other: a powerful predator dating to the age of the dinosaurs. Treasured as a status symbol believed to bring good luck, the Asian arowana is bred on high-security farms in Southeast Asia and sold by the hundreds of thousands each year. In the United States, however, it&#x2019;s protected by the Endangered Species Act and illegal to bring into the country&#x2014;though it remains the object of a thriving black market.

In an age when freshwater fish now comprise one of the most rapidly vanishing groups of animals on the planet, Voigt unearths a paradoxical truth behind the dragon fish&#x2019;s rise to fame&#x2014;one that calls into question how we protect the world&#x2019;s rarest species. An elegant exploration of the human conquest of nature, <i>The Dragon Behind the Glass </i>revels in the sheer wonder of life&#x2019;s diversity and lays bare our deepest desire&#x2014;to hold onto what is wild.</p><p>Emily Voigt is a journalist specializing in science and culture.

The entire scene was gray&#x2014;the potholed roads, the sooty snow, the late-winter sky&#x2014;except the officers themselves, who provided the only glimmer of green. Rather than standard NYPD issue, they wore olive uniforms and trooper hats, � la Ranger Smith from The Yogi Bear Show. As they crunched across the unshoveled walkway, a passing teenage girl wisecracked, &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t you supposed to be in the forest?&#x201d;<br> <br>Fitzpatrick, who had been patrolling the same beat since 1996, ignored her, keeping his eyes trained on one of the brick high-rises lined up like dominoes. As a cop (of sorts) from Brooklyn, descended from a clan of cops from Brooklyn, he looked the part, a towering man of forty-one with a crew cut and dimpled chin. Tucked under his arm was a file containing a photograph of the suspect he was after&#x2014;someone he believed could be armed and dangerous.<br> <br>Inside, the building&#x2019;s lobby was dimly lit and gloomy. The elevator clattered open, and we crowded in, squeaking up to the eighth floor, where the officers&#x2019; boots echoed down the long hall before halting outside one apartment. Fitzpatrick pounded on the door. After half a minute passed and nothing happened, he raised his fist again, pounding harder and longer. A baby cried down the hall. At last, a male voice, gravelly with sleep, croaked, &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;State Environmental Police,&#x201d; Fitzpatrick announced.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; said the voice, sounding genuinely confused.<br> <br>The door cracked open to reveal a stocky young man with full-sleeve tattoos wearing flannel pajama bottoms, his eyes squinting against the light. His name was Jason Cruz. Asked if he knew what brought the officers to his door, he shook his head no and said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; Fitzpatrick enlightened him, &#x201c;because of the alligator that you were offering to sell on Craigslist.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<br> <br>I WAS REPORTING a story about exotic pets for a science program on NPR, and it had taken me six months to get permission to join Fitzpatrick, a detective with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, on one of his busts. When I&#x2019;d first called him the previous summer, I&#x2019;d found him brimming with bizarre tales from an urban bestiary. During his time policing the city&#x2019;s illegal wildlife trade, he had encountered everything from gorilla-hand ashtrays to twelve hundred turtles crammed into a swank Tribeca loft, their owner left with no room for a bed. There was the Harlem man who kept Ming the tiger and Al the alligator in the apartment where his mother was raising eight small children; the wealthy Brooklyn family who treated their African Diana monkey, one of the rarest primate species on earth, like a second daughter&#x2014;even threatening to barricade their home if marshals tried to take her away; and the proprietor of a popular curio store in SoHo who landed in prison for selling not only a chimpanzee skeleton and walrus tusks but also human body parts. From time to time, a notorious dealer called Mr. Anything Man surfaced in his jalopy advertising exotic live animals, dead or alive.<br> <br>Anything. It&#x2019;s the theme of the city&#x2019;s wildlife trade. Sure enough, when Fitzpatrick asked the pajama-clad Cruz how he came by the alligator he&#x2019;d been trying to sell, Cruz shrugged and said, &#x201c;This is the Bronx. You can get anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>Inside his apartment, which was small and tidy with a black leather couch, flatscreen TV, and mirrored photograph of the Manhattan skyline, a dog barked from the bathroom. Birds tweeted in the kitchen. Fitzpatrick walked over to a trio of tanks and inspected a leopard gecko in one and, in the other, a teaspoon-size baby Nile monitor&#x2014;a yellow-striped lizard with a blue, forked tongue fond of devouring cats when full grown. The third tank was empty, except for a few inches of stagnant water, which Fitzpatrick leaned in to sniff suspiciously. &#x201c;So where is the alligator now?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I gave it back,&#x201d; Cruz said, claiming he&#x2019;d bought the reptile from a stranger outside PetSmart on Pelham Parkway. Though it was only a foot long, his girlfriend had pointed out its likelihood of enlarging and insisted that it had to go for the sake of their two-year-old daughter. After this ultimatum, Cruz said he tried to unload the gator online, but Craigslist flagged the ad; so he returned it to the dealer who sold it to him in the first place. &#x201c;He was a Puerto Rican dude,&#x201d; he offered.<br> <br>Fitzpatrick jotted this on a notepad. &#x201c;Now it&#x2019;s down to just a few million people in the Bronx,&#x201d; he said drily.<br> <br>I was as disappointed as Fitzpatrick to have narrowly missed the alligator. I&#x2019;d been hoping for a scene like the time he taped up the snout of a three-foot-long caiman and drove it thrashing in his front passenger seat to the Bronx Zoo. What&#x2019;s more, Cruz didn&#x2019;t live up to Fitzpatrick&#x2019;s billing of the typical alligator aficionado as an exemplar of machismo and aggression. Pet alligators were supposed to be particularly hot among gang members and drug dealers, but Cruz didn&#x2019;t seem like either. Before his daughter was born, he used to keep pit bulls, as evidenced by black leather harnesses with metal studs hanging from the wall; but the dog barking in the bathroom turned out to be a poodle.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can really get in trouble over, like, an alligator?&#x201d; Cruz asked Fitzpatrick, still bewildered by what was happening.<br> <br>His pregnant girlfriend, who had emerged from the bedroom, yawning and looking unamused, added, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot of people that sell alligators.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a criminal offense,&#x201d; Fitzpatrick told them, explaining that New York State prohibits the commercial sale of live crocodilians, while the city goes further, banning just about every exotic pet from scorpions to ferrets to polar bears. The Nile monitor was illegal too and would have to be seized. Cruz looked crestfallen as his girlfriend found an empty shoebox, into which he gingerly lifted the tiny lizard, wrapping it in a T-shirt to protect it from the cold.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s not many animals you can keep here,&#x201d; Fitzpatrick advised him, &#x201c;except a dog, cat, goldfish, canary&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I got like twenty lovebirds!&#x201d; Cruz exclaimed.<br> <br>In the kitchen, Fitzpatrick inspected the stacked cages of small, green parrots with yellow chests and red beaks, deeming them permissible.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I didn&#x2019;t have kids or nothing, I would&#x2019;ve had cobras here, vipers, all types of stuff,&#x201d; Cruz said wistfully, explaining that he had loved animals since he was a child, particularly after escaping the Bronx to visit his aunt in Florida where alligators sunned themselves in the backyard and took dips in the swimming pool. While waiting for the officers to write up a court summons, he called his mother and told her that he was going to be on Animal Planet.<br> <br>&#x201c;NPR,&#x201d; I mouthed, then frowned, recalling how my producer had requested high drama&#x2014;something along the lines of a wildebeest in Queens.<br> <br>After hanging up, Cruz turned to me and grew philosophical: &#x201c;You know what it is? You like animals, and you get tired of seeing the same animals over and over. You go to the pet store, and they have this and that&#x2014;and you know everybody&#x2019;s got it. So you try to get something different.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Honestly, that&#x2019;s part of the problem,&#x201d; Fitzpatrick said as he handed over the summons. &#x201c;Then you get into endangered species.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Cruz, marveling at how easily he could acquire a fifteen-foot anaconda rumored to be for sale, didn&#x2019;t seem to hear.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<br> <br>MORE EXOTIC ANIMALS are believed to live in American homes than in American zoos. Yet the desire of someone like Cruz to keep an alligator in his living room defies classic theories of pet-keeping, which hold that humans keep pets for unconditional love, for example, or because a misdirected cute response (the scientific term) compels us to care for other species the way we do our own offspring. Alligators are neither affectionate nor cute, at least not in the sense of being cuddly and having large eyes, a round face, and an oversize head like a human infant or a pug dog. Rather, the appeal seems to lie in the opposite direction&#x2014;the alligator&#x2019;s ferocity, its wild and untamable nature.<br> <br>In a way, what Cruz had assembled in his Bronx apartment could be seen as having a long historical precedent. It was a menagerie, a collection of exotic creatures kept in captivity for exhibition. Menageries first appeared with the advent of urbanization, when contact with wild animals became rare, and the keeping of exotics was almost exclusively the privilege of royalty and nobility. Mesopotamian kings, who received foreign beasts as tribute, created elaborate gardens to house them called paradeisoi, later to serve as the model for the biblical Garden of Eden. Egyptian pharaohs collected baboons, hippos, and elephants from sub-Saharan Africa and had them mummified to take into the afterlife. In the classical world, the Greeks brought back wild animals from military expeditions, a tradition their Roman conquerors continued, slaughtering the beasts in public arenas, a popular entertainment for nearly five hundred years. The Tower of London gained its famed royal menagerie in 1204. Across the Atlantic, Lord Moctezuma dazzled the first conquistadores with his magnificent pleasure gardens, replete with rare aquatic birds and wildcats tended by their own physicians. With the European discovery of the New World, the desire to own exotic animals intensified, and the Renaissance saw the invention of the private &#x201c;cabinet of curiosities.&#x201d; By the eighteenth century, the aristocracy was clamoring for monkeys and parrots as novel playthings.<br> <br>The human species is unique in its compulsion to tame and nurture nearly all other vertebrate animals. In his 1984 classic, Dominance &amp; Affection: The Making of Pets, the cultural geographer Yi-Fu Tuan characterizes this proclivity as an exercise in power&#x2014;a kind of playful domination stemming from our desire to control the unpredictable forces of nature. According to Tuan, the keeping of pets reflects our hunger for status symbols, for what the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called the &#x201c;carnal, clinging, humble, organic, milky taste of the creature,&#x201d; which underlies all luxury goods.<br> <br>The modern pet shop first appeared in American cities in the 1890s; and with it began the mass importation of exotic animals from Asia and South America. Pet-keeping in the United States exploded in the economic boom following World War II and, since the 1970s, has more than tripled. For the first time in history, more American households have pets than don&#x2019;t, including some 86 million cats and 78 million dogs. But no one knows how many &#x201c;exotics&#x201d; there are, not least because no one agrees how to define an exotic pet. Does a native but wild animal like a skunk count? What about a potbellied pig? Further complicating matters, much of the trade operates underground, flouting state and federal laws.<br> <br>In the 1980s, wild birds comprised the hottest segment of the black market. Next to take off was the &#x201c;herp trade,&#x201d; short for herpetoculture, which is the keeping of reptiles and amphibians such as turtles, lizards, and salamanders. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you have the big-buck items,&#x201d; Fitzpatrick told me. He described how he once went undercover posing as a reptile collector to buy a critically endangered $18,000 radiated tortoise from Madagascar with a brilliant star pattern on its shell. As he was making the purchase, the dealer showed him a picture of a one-of-a-kind turtle&#x2014;an albino river cooter, its entire body a pale jade white&#x2014;and said he&#x2019;d been offered $101,000 for the animal but was holding out for more.<br> <br>On that occasion, wary of being searched, Fitzpatrick had slipped his gun into a drawer in another room, and when his backup team was delayed, he began to sweat. Though the dealer didn&#x2019;t resist arrest, high-stakes turtle trafficking can be tied up with all sorts of unsavory behavior. Interpol warns that organized-crime networks use the same routes to smuggle animals as they do weapons, drugs, and people&#x2014;that environmental crime goes hand in hand with corruption, money laundering, even murder.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<br> <br>IT WAS FITZPATRICK who first told me about the Asian arowana. At the time, I still thought of pet fish as one step up from potted plants. Had someone informed me that fish comprise the vast majority of exotic pets&#x2014;that they are the most common pet, period, with more than 100 million swimming in aquariums across the United States&#x2014;I would not have cared one bit. If there was anything appealing about them, it was their comic irrelevancy and their association with childhood.<br> <br>When I was little, my parents got a tank of goldfish as a sorry substitute for a dog or cat. One day when I was about six, I noticed bubbles escaping from the fish&#x2019;s puckering mouths and wondered if they were talking to each other. Retrieving my Fisher-Price stethoscope, I pushed a chair next to the aquarium and climbed up to listen for tiny voices rising from the water&#x2019;s surface. All I heard was silence. After that, I ignored them, and they continued to ignore me.<br> <br>Not everyone, however, shared my dispassion. &#x201c;One thing we deal with here in the city is a fish,&#x201d; Fitzpatrick told me. &#x201c;Arowana.&#x201d; I misheard this as &#x201c;marijuana,&#x201d; and the association proved surprisingly apt. Protected by the Endangered Species Act, the Asian arowana cannot legally be brought into the United States as a pet. Yet trafficking is rampant across the country. Fitzpatrick recounted a bust at a dingy Brooklyn sweatshop, where women sat hunched over sewing machines, scraps of fabric strewn about the floor&#x2014;a front for running fish. Another time, acting on a tip, he caught a Malaysian-born Queens man smuggling arowana through JFK Airport in water-filled baggies packed in a suitcase. Fitzpatrick noted that even the cheapest specimens sold for thousands of dollars, and prices went up from there, depending on coloration, the most desirable being red. &#x201c;In certain Asian populations the arowana is considered good luck or a sign of prosperity or a status symbol,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s been overharvested for the pet trade for those reasons.&#x201d;<br> <br>The obsession with the fish, however, wasn&#x2019;t limited to Asian cultures. There was, for example, the Wall Street banker who broke down crying after he was arrested for possession of the species, confessing he couldn&#x2019;t resist its dark-alley appeal. &#x201c;In recent years, we&#x2019;ve seen more cases involving non-Asians&#x2014;white people,&#x201d; Fitzpatrick said. The previous summer, two Long Island men had been caught at the Canadian border, driving back from Montreal with four specimens swimming in the spare-tire well of their SUV. Then a young man was busted running arowana from his family&#x2019;s home in the suburbs. Fitzpatrick theorized that selling black-market fish was considered safer than dealing in other high-value contraband such as drugs and guns&#x2014;especially in New York, where just twenty environmental conservation officers cover the same territory as some thirty-four thousand NYPD.<br> <br>The way he saw it, wildlife traffickers were motivated by pure greed, participating in what may well be the world&#x2019;s most profitable form of illegal trade. But the collectors were driven by a passion he found easier to relate to. &#x201c;I think that a lot of the ...</p><h2>Active Physical Science Student Edition</h2><p>Book contains two units, Active Physics and Active Chemistry.</p><p></p><h2>Oliver Twist (The World&#39;s best reading)</h2><p>An orphan living on the dangerous London streets, Oliver has no one but himself to rely on.

Church. This story recounts the fascinating tale of Aeneas, the legendary ancestor of Romulus, who escaped from the burning city of Troy and wandered the Mediterranean for years before settling in Italy. His adventures onece arriving in Latium are no less interesting since he must fight the jealous suitor Turnus for the hand of the princess Lavinia. Patterned after the Iliad and the Odyssey, the Aeneid was described in an epic poem by Virgil to glorify the imperial city of Rome. Alfred Church&#x2019;s retelling of Virgil&#x2019;s Aeneid is a great introduction to Aeneas, who escaped from the burning city of Troy and founded Rome. After reading this novel, students will have a good grasp on the characters and story of the Aeneid and be ready to tackle the more difficult prose in Virgil.

But the recent sensational discovery and publication of the long lost <em>Gospel of Judas</em>, with its remarkable portrayal of Judas Iscariot as the disciple closest to Jesus, raises serious new questions. Was Judas the only member of the Twelve who truly understood Jesus? Did Jesus secretly collaborate with Judas to set in motion the series of events that would redeem all of humankind? In search of answers, Marvin Meyer, one of the world's leading experts on the <em>Gospel of Judas</em> presents a collection of the earliest accounts of Judas, which together paint a fuller portrait of this most enigmatic disciple.</p><p>This book presents the essential texts that deal with the figure of Judas, including New Testament writings, Gnostic documents, and other early and later Christian literature. These are the earliest known testimonies about Judas and include selections from the gospels of <em>Mark</em>, <em>Matthew</em>, <em>Luke</em>, and <em>John</em>, the <em>Acts of the Apostles</em>, and relevant passages from Paul. The centerpiece of the book is the <em>Gospel of Judas</em>, followed by excerpts from three other Gnostic texts&#x2014;the <em>Dialogue of the Savior</em>, the <em>Concept of Our Great Power</em>, and the "Round Dance of the Cross"&#x2014;which may shed new light on the figure of Judas. A series of additional writings on Judas produced over the centuries provide glimpses of the vilification of Judas and the emergence of anti-Semitic themes.</p><p>Meyer offers evidence of traitors before Judas&#x2014;the Genesis story of Joseph's brothers who sold him into slavery, the duplicitous friend of the poet in <em>Psalm</em> 41, and Melanthius the goatherd in Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>&#x2014;all of which raise the question of whether the story of Judas Iscariot could be simply a piece of religious fiction derived from earlier stories. </p><p><em>Judas</em> provides a rich collection of original sources that tell the story of Christianity's most infamous figure, offering the fullest understanding of Judas Iscariot's undeniable importance in the climax of Jesus's life.</p></p><p><p>Marvin Meyer is one of the <em>foremost</em> scholars on early Christianity and texts about Jesus outside the New Testament. He is Griset Professor of Bible and Christian Studies at Chapman University in Orange, California. Among his recent books are <em>The Gospel of Judas</em>, <em>The Gnostic Gospels of Jesus</em>, <em>The Gospels of Mary</em>, <em>The Gospel of Thomas</em>, and <em>The Nag Hammadi Scriptures</em>.</p></p><h2>Moon Rocky Mountain National Park (Travel Guide)</h2><p><br><b>Moon Travel Guides: Find Your Adventure</b><br><br>Incredible wildlife, stunning glaciers and waterfalls, and unforgettable adventure awaits you in <i>Moon Rocky Mountain National Park</i>.<br><br><b><i>Moon Rocky Mountain National Park</i> features:</b><br><ul><li><b>Itineraries for every timeline and budget,</b> ranging from one day in the park to a week-long trip, including: Family Fun, Day Hikes, Winter Adventures, and Gaga for Glaciers</li><li><b>Strategies for getting to Rocky Mountain National Park,</b> avoiding crowds, and exploring its less-visited areas</li><li><b>In-depth chapters on each region of the park, </b>including Bear Lake and the East Side, Longs Peak and Wild Basin, Trail Ridge Road, Kawuneeche Valley, and Lumpy Ridge and the Mummy Range</li><li><b>Coverage of gateway cities and towns,</b> including Estes Park, Grand Lake, and Arapaho National Recreation Area</li><li><b>Full-color, vibrant photos and detailed maps throughout</b></li><li><b>Expert tips for travelers </b>looking to go hiking, biking, skiing, and more, plus essential packing and health and safety information</li><li><b>Detailed hike descriptions</b> with individual trail maps and backpacking options</li><li><b>The top activities and unique ideas for exploring the park: </b>Hike the dramatic glacier-formed gorges to find jaw-dropping waterfalls, and spot elk, moose, and bighorn sheep along the way.

Included are works by Leigh Brackett, C. L. Moore, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Judith Merril. Introduction and Bibliography by the Editor.<br></p><p>Pamela Sargent (born March 20, 1948) is an American, feminist, science fiction author, and editor. She has an MA in classical philosophy and has won a Nebula Award. She wrote a series concerning the terraforming of Venus that is sometimes compared to Kim Stanley Robinson&#39;s Mars trilogy, but predates it. She also edited various anthologies to celebrate the contributions of women in the history of science fiction. She is noted for writing alternate history stories. Sargent has attempted work with a wide variety of themes in general, if not always successfully. She also collaborated with George Zebrowski and on numerous Star Trek novels.It's no revelation that men make up the majority of science fiction authors and audiences, but female authors have made substantial contributions to the genre and are becoming increasingly important. In the '70s, Sargent edited three Women of Wonder anthologies, and 18 writers from this original trio (some with new stories) are joined here by three newcomers to the series, to give an eye-opening overview of science fiction and women between 1944 and 1978. Exploring topics such as prejudice, child abuse, vanity, stereotypes, aging, rape, obesity and insanity, stories by Marion Zimmer Bradley, Zenna Henderson, Kit Reed, Kate Wilhelm, Joan Vinge, the pseudonymous James Tiptree Jr. and others are as disconcerting as they are intriguing. Judith Merril's "That Only a Mother" capitalizes on the fear of nuclear warfare as a new mother deals with the effects of radiation in her own unique way. Anne McCaffrey's "The Ship Who Sang" carries the idea that ships are feminine one step further when a spaceship falls in love with her pilot. Sargent highlights the history of women in science fiction in an information-packed introduction. In addition, notes about each author and an extensive bibliography will satisfy the curiosity of those wanting additional information on this topic. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Winnie the Pooh</h2><p>Pooh straps on his backpack and goes out searching for honey with his pal Piglet in this adorable new plush toy and board book format.</p><p>Alexander Lenard was a Hungarian writer, poet, artist, linguist and teacher. His Latin translation of Winnie-the-Pooh, which took seven years to complete, was published in the UK in 1960 and immediately became a bestseller. A.A. Milne wrote some 18 plays and three novels, and fathered a son, Christopher Robin Milne, in 1920. Christopher led Milne to produce a book of children&#39;s poetry, When We Were Very Young, in 1924, and in 1926 the seminal Winnie-the-Pooh. More poems followed in Now We Are Six (1927) and Pooh returned in The House at Pooh Corner (1928). E. H. Shepard famously illustrated both Winnie-the-Pooh and The Wind in the Willows though, like A. A. Milne, much of his career was devoted to work for the satirical magazine Punch.This program exemplifies the potential quality audio has for complementing text. Soothing music introduces and links the stories and verses. Subtle sounds of nature immerse the listener in Pooh&#39;s world and provide a backdrop for Peter Dennis&#39;s enchanting performance. Dennis&#39;s ability to switch characters and moods allows him to accurately portray the range of characters in the stories--from the melancholy sound of Eeyore&#39;s voice to Pooh&#39;s empty-headed speech. These talents shine prominently in the &#34;When We Were Very Young&#34; poems. Dennis expresses the multitude of emotions in a child-like tone which is key to the success of the program. All ages will enjoy this marvelous performance of Milne&#39;s words. M.P.T.

He is also the author of over fifty books. These range from adult fiction to specialist titles, such as Forensic Aspects of Sleep, to a wide selection of children&#39;s books. In 1999 The No 1 Ladies&#39; Detective Agency was published.

Iyer follows Greene&#x2019;s trail from his first novel, <i>The Man Within</i>, to such later classics as <i>The Quiet American</i> and begins to unpack all he has in common with Greene: an English public school education, a lifelong restlessness and refusal to make a home anywhere, a fascination with the complications of faith. The deeper Iyer plunges into their haunted kinship, the more he begins to wonder whether the man within his head is not Greene but his own father, or perhaps some more shadowy aspect of himself. <br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing upon experiences across the globe, from Cuba to Bhutan, and moving, as Greene would, from Sri Lanka in war to intimate moments of introspection; trying to make sense of his own past, commuting between the cloisters of a fifteenth-century boarding school and California in the 1960s, one of our most resourceful explorers of crossing cultures gives us his most personal and revelatory book.</p><p>Pico Iyer has written nonfiction books on globalism, Japan, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, and forgotten places, and novels on Revolutionary Cuba and Islamic mysticism. He regularly writes on literature for <i>The New York Review of Books, </i>on travel for the <i>Financial Times, </i>and on global culture and the news for <i>Time, The New York Times, </i>and magazines around the world.9<br><br>There were fires raging all across the hills around our house, and I was sitting in a downtown restaurant with my mother and Hiroko. I&#x2019;d flown into Santa Barbara two days before, and, driving along the empty road that leads from the airport to our house ten minutes away, I&#x2019;d looked up into the hills to where the lights of our home shine alone on our ridge, and my heart had stopped. There were two bright blazes of orange cutting through the darkness, with a speed and effi- ciency I remembered from the time when our home&#x2014;in the same location&#x2014;had burned down (with me beside it) some years before.<br><br>I accelerated wildly up the hill and started taking the curves along the mountain road leading up to our solitary house at a crazy speed. The air to the north was already red and full of smoke&#x2014;infernal&#x2014;and as I pushed the car to go faster, I saw sightseers along the side of the road gathering to watch the unearthly light show, great towers of orange, a hundred feet high, rising from the valleys just below our home and smoke turning the sky into a sickly pall.<br><br>I swerved, brakes screaming, into our driveway, and sum- moned my wife and mother out to see what was happening a mile or two away. It looked to be remote still, but I remem- bered how, during the previous fire, the flames had raced through the brush at seventy miles an hour, so that an orange gash in what looked to be a distant slope was suddenly a pillar of flames arcing over our living-room windows.<br><br>The next day we awoke to the sound of helicopters whir- ring overhead. The sky was a grisly blood-red color. The house felt hot already, and, although the smoke seemed to clear as the wind shifted and returned us to a placid blue midsummer day, as the afternoon went on the sky above the ridge next to us turned a hideous, end-of-the-world color, or discolor really, ash falling around us like snow.<br><br>I went with Hiroko down to the post office, and as we came out, after a short transaction, the whole suburb around us was black with coughy smoke. We looked up to the hills, to where our house and our far-off neighbors were, and all we could see were one, two, three slashes of orange angrily starting up across the slopes. We began to drive home and, switching on the radio, I heard that our house and the few up the road had been issued an &#x201c;evacuation warning.&#x201d; I turned into our little road and began driving up it, and the announcer on the local radio, frantic, said that the &#x201c;evacuation warning&#x201d; had been turned into an &#x201c;order&#x201d;: we had to leave now, or we would be forced out.<br><br>We drove the remaining five minutes at a crazy speed again, collected my mother, her dazed cat inside a little cage, gath- ered as many precious papers and photos as we could in five minutes and then tore down the road again, fire trucks coming past us in the opposite direction, plumes of smoke seeming to rise from all the valleys and the crevices in the hills, the air so thick we were choking already and driving out of what seemed to be an oven, the huge flames cresting above our house as if ready to engulf it.<br><br>Now, barely twenty minutes away, downtown Santa Barbara was dreaming through another placid blue-sky afternoon, a miracle of calm; the angry smoke and orange burns to the north seemed to belong to another universe. We had to go about our life as usual&#x2014;the next day would bring a fireworks display along the beach, for July the Fourth, and the day after that, I was due to perform a wedding ceremony for a college friend who was flying over from England for the occasion. We needed dinner, preferably in some inexpensive place not far from the house where we were staying while technically homeless (the same building that had housed my mother and me for four months after our house burned down before).<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a story of the Buddha,&#x201d; my mother began telling us now, perhaps to take our mind off the conflagration, and I listened to her, though usually all the wisdom that came from her, a teacher of comparative religions, I tried to block out because I was a son. &#x201c;When his closest disciple, Ananda, asked him what was the greatest miracle,&#x201d; she went on, &#x201c;walking on water or conjuring jewels out of thin air, changing the heat of one&#x2019;s body through meditation or sitting undisturbed in a cave for years and years, he said, &#x2018;Simply touching the heart of another human being. Acting kindly. That&#x2019;s the greatest miracle of all.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The church of humanity, in other words,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;like Gra- ham Greene.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t care that I was citing the very writer my mother had liked when I was at school and I had mocked. (&#x201c;You remember,&#x201d; she said, not unexpectedly, &#x201c;who it was who told you to read Graham Greene?&#x201d;). &#x201c;It was what he always believed in, the human predicament, the possibility for kind- ness and honesty even in the midst of our confusions and our sins. He could never quite bring himself to believe in God; God was the Other with whom he played his incessant games of &#x2018;He loves me, He loves me not.&#x2019; But in humanity he had the strongest, if most reluctant belief. In our fallenness lies our salvation.&#x201d;<br><br>The other two looked at me blankly, nonplussed by this explosion. &#x201c;He never could have much confidence in faith and hope,&#x201d; I said, concluding a sermon that no one had asked for. &#x201c;But charity was the one thing he couldn&#x2019;t turn away from. Many writers try to take a journey into the Other. But in him it becomes a kind of creed, his version of religion, even when he&#x2019;s just traveling into the Other in himself.&#x201d;<br><br>What I really could have been saying was that we were now in the world he&#x2019;d made so real to me in his books, at the mercy of much larger forces, pushed back to essentials, without a home. The only thing you could possibly do in such circum- stances was see that so many others were in a similar predica- ment and reach out towards them; what you shared was not faith, usually, but unsettledness.<br><br>Up in the hills, meanwhile, the fires continued to blaze.</p><h2>The Haight-ashbury: a History</h2><p>This comprehensive account of San Francisco&#39;s Haight-Ashbury draws on personal experiences, period documents, and scores of interviews to illuminate and assess an important counterculture phenomenon</p><p></p><h2>Complete Jewish Bible-OE</h2><p>Why is this Bible different from all other Bibles?

Stern, born in Los Angeles in 1935, is the great-grandson of two of the city&#39;s first twenty Jews. He earned a Ph.D. in economics at Princeton University and was a professor at UCLA. In 1972 he came to faith in Yeshua the Messiah. He then received a Master of Divinity degree at Fuller Theological Seminary, did graduate work at the University of Judaism, and was active in the Messianic Jewish movement. In 1979 the Stern family made aliyah (immigrated to Israel); they now live in Jerusalem. Dr. Stern authored the &#34;Messianic Jewish Manifesto&#34;. His highly acclaimed English translation, the &#34;Jewish New Testament,&#34; restores the New Testament&#39;s Jewishness. His &#34;Jewish New Testament Commentary&#34; discusses the many Jewish issues found in the New Testament. His fresh translation, the &#34;Complete Jewish Bible&#34;, expresses the unity of the Tanakh (&#34;Old Testament&#34;) and the B&#39;rit Hadashah (&#34;New Testament&#34;). This outstanding, scholarly work offers Bible readers a thorough, biblically Jewish version of God&#39;s word.</p><h2>The Science of Getting Rich</h2><p>The Science of Getting Rich is a book written by Wallace D.

According to USA Today, the text is &#34;divided into 17 short, straight-to-the-point chapters that explain how to overcome mental barriers, and how creation, not competition, is the hidden key to wealth attraction.&#34; The Science of Getting Rich preceded similar financial success books such as The Master Key System by Charles F. Haanel (1912) and Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill (1937). In the 100 years since its publication, it has gone through many editions, and remains in print from more than one publisher. The Science of Getting Rich was credited by Rhonda Byrne as one of the inspirations for her popular 2006 film and 2007 book The Secret.</p><p>This classic Wallace D. Wattles title has often been compared to Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, and many believe they act as excellent companion titles. Individuals who have read books by Robert Allen, Suze Orman or David Bach will find often find this title to as well be of interest.The man who owns all he wants for the living of all the life he is capable of living is rich; and no man who has not plenty of money can have all he wants. Life has advanced so far, and become so complex, that even the most ordinary man or woman requires a great amount of wealth in order to live in a manner that even approaches completeness. Every person naturally wants to become all that they are capable of becoming; this desire to realize innate possibilities is inherent in human nature; we cannot help wanting to be all that we can be. Success in life is becoming what you want to be; you can become what you want to be only by making use of things, and you can have the free use of things only as you become rich enough to buy them. To understand the science of getting rich is therefore the most essential of all knowledge. <p>In writing this book I have sacrificed all other considerations to plainness and simplicity of style, so that all might understand. The plan of action laid down herein was deduced from the conclusions of philosophy; it has been thoroughly tested, and bears the supreme test of practical experiment; it works. If you wish to know how the conclusions were arrived at, read the writings of the authors mentioned above; and if you wish to reap the fruits of their philosophies in actual practice, read this book and do exactly as it tells you to do.</p></p><h2>Prentice Hall Mathematics: Pre-Algebra, Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Prentice Hall Pre- Algebra 2004 copyright.

Frank Baum first published his <i>Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>, countless authors and illustrators have adapted, interpreted, and retold this story of Dorothy and her unusual companions, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion. But for sheer opulence and sumptuous color, award-winning artist Charles Santore's 100th anniversary edition takes the cake. Santore's large, fairy-tale style watercolors feature ominous, shadowy forests, magnificent but deadly poppies, the whimsical, green-tinted landscapes of Oz, and the golden gray fields of Kansas. Each page is awash in color; many of the two-page spreads have no text to distract readers from the illustrations' myriad details--not-yet-blooming poppy buds, the Tin Woodman's watering can head, and the radiant good witch, Glinda, posing on her ruby-encrusted throne. The text is condensed rather than adapted; so virtually every word is Baum's own. Although some scenes have been left out, Baum's classic story rings through, loud and clear. Sharing this lush edition with a favorite child would be the perfect way to celebrate a century of Oz. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>This special 100th-anniversary edition of L. Frank Baum's classic features eye-catching embossed gold foil on a centennial medallion as well as on the title. Santore's <i>Wizard of Oz</i> is widely acknowledged as the quintessential illustrated version of the tale for the picture book audience. His lush, full-color illustrations grace every page of the faithfully condensed text--no language other than Baum's has been used. This special edition is the perfect one to share with the youngest children.</p><h2>Popeye Volume 1</h2><p><ul> <li>Popeye the Sailor Man sails again! E.C.

Legend has it that as a child, he was fed a cake filled with the letters of the alphabet, and so learned to love writing. He grew up to become a monk and a scribe a thousand years before the invention of printing, when books had to be copied by hand.<br><br>There was one book, a beautiful volume of psalms from distant Rome, that Columcille especially loved, and even though its owner refused him permission, Columcille secretly copied it. The copy was discovered, and a dispute arose over who it belonged to: Columcille, who made it, or the owner of the original. So better was the argument that a battle was fought between the two men's powerful friends; although Columcille's side won, the victory felt hollow to him. To punish himself, he set out in a tiny boat, vowing to leave Ireland forever.<br><br>A revered figure in Celtic history, Columcille (also known as Columbia) founded the famous monastery on the Scottish island of Iona and left a legacy of learning that illuminated a corner of the Dark Ages. History, drama, and a love of books and reading fill a story--told here in exquisite watercolors and deflty understated prose by noted author and artist Don Brown.<br></p><p>Don Brown's previous books include the "ingeniously staged and picture perfect" (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review) <i>Mack Made Movies</i> and the recently published K<i>id Blink Beats the World</i>. He lives on Long Island, New York.<br>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;Brown's lyrical narrative chronicles the life of Columcille, born to an Irish king in 521, and his passionate commitment to words and ideas. Though he grew up during the Dark Ages, when the new rulers of Ireland had virtually extinguished education ("Reading and writing were like magic, and the people who knew their secrets as rare as wizards"), Columcille from early childhood loved writing, which he mastered as a student in a monastery. He went on to become a monk as well as a skilled scribe and poet, and founded many monasteries. Brown laces historical facts with anecdotes from legends in his portrayal of this remarkable man, who exiled himself from his homeland after his kinsmen crushed the army of a High King, in defense of a manuscript. Columcille had painstakingly hand-lettered a Psalter (book of Psalms) and the king had ruled that the copy belonged to the owner of the original manuscript. In penitence for the bloodshed, Columcille decided to exile himself from his homeland, and ended up on the Scottish island of Iona, and there founded a monastery. He and the other resident scribes there devoted themselves to transcribing manuscripts, creating books that were then "dispatched, like small boats on a dark and wild sea, to places where reading and writing had been forgotten or ignored." Like the work of his subject, Brown's account also sheds light on an intriguing individual of extraordinary accomplishment. The author's signature stark, muted watercolors seem especially well suited to this hero's life of piety and his historical setting.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bulletin, Center for Children's Books&nbsp;Both involving and credible. . . Brown captures the monastic infighting and clan warfare, spiritual dedication and passionate defense of learning that have shaped Columcille&#x2019;s renown.&nbsp; Chill olive greens and khaki browns mistily tint watercolor scenes of monastery, battlefield, and swollen sea, softening to a more verdant hue for Columcille&#x2019;s final settlement on the Scottish island of Iona.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Horn Book&nbsp;Brown&#x2019;s text is lilting, the sentences varied in length and intensity, making it suitable for reading aloud.&nbsp; But fine as it is, it has to take second place to the illustrations.&nbsp; They are almost dreamlike in quality&#x2014;as if we were seeing the Dark Ages emerging from the mists.&nbsp; The watercolor medium is beautifully manipulated to achieve these effects; the page design is dramatic, particularly the double-page spread of Columcille&#x2019;s coracle battling the wild seas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirkus Reviews Starred Review&nbsp;Brown (A Voice from the Wilderness, 2001, etc.) continues his series of picture-book biographies of lesser-known figures with a tale of the life of Saint Columcille, the sixth century prince and monk better known by the Latin form of his name, Columba.&nbsp; In Ireland in Columcille&#x2019;s time, &#x201c;Reading and writing were like magic, and the people who knew their secrets as rare as wizards.&nbsp; Columcille became one of them.&#x201d;&nbsp; When a former teacher, Finnian, would not permit him to copy a book of psalms, he did so in secret.&nbsp; The high king Diarmait ruled that the copy, too, belonged to Finnian and a fierce battle erupted.&nbsp; Though Columcille got his book back, he was devastated at the bloodshed, and took a leather boat to Iona, off the coast of Scotland.&nbsp; The monastery he founded there, and its scriptorium, dispatched books &#x201c;like small boats on a dark and wild sea.&#x201d;&nbsp; Reading as magical and books worthy of being fought over are lovely lessons laid out in the powerful story.&nbsp; Brown&#x2019;s usual tender watercolors take on a darker hue.&nbsp; Double-paged, wordless spreads of the battle and of the sea add to the depth of the images, as do lucid step-by-step pictures of the making of a manuscript book and the building of a coracle (leather boat).&nbsp; An alphabet of exquisite Irish uncial letters and an author&#x2019;s note add to the richness.&nbsp; This works on many levels to delight and to inspire; as a stirring read-aloud, as a saint&#x2019;s biography, and as a beautiful picture book.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Booklist Starred Review&nbsp;Brown, creator of such picture-book biographies such as Alice Ramsey&#x2019;s Grand Adventure (1997) and Uncommon Traveler: Mary Kingsley in Africa (2000), here traces the life of Columcille.&nbsp; Better known as Saint Columba, Columcille was born a prince of a sixth-century Irish clan and became a monk and a scribe.&nbsp; When a dispute over ownership of a copied manuscript erupted into battle in which thousands died, Columcille left Ireland to found a monastery on the Scottish island of Iona.&nbsp; There, monks devoted themselves to copying manuscripts, and those copies were sent out into the world, where they lightened the intellectual darkness of the age.&nbsp; Setting the scene after the fall of the Roman Empire, when a great deal of knowledge had been lost and learning was little valued, Brown states &#x201c;Reading and writing were like magic, and the people who knew their secrets are rare as wizards.&#x201d;&nbsp; What a powerful idea for children working to master those skills today.&nbsp; This picture-book biography is gracefully written and illustrated with great delicacy and finesse.&nbsp; The illustrations, ink drawings with watercolor washes, feature muted greens, grays, and tans.&nbsp; An informative author&#x2019;s note, a page demonstrating &#x201c;hand lettering from the time of Columcille,&#x201d; and a bibliography round out the presentation of this comely book on an unusual subject.&nbsp;

Brown describes his subject&#x2019;s fascination with a rare book of Bible psalms and his secret vow to make an illegal copy.&nbsp; The High King declared that the duplicate manuscript was the property of the owner of the original, and a terrible battle ensued.&nbsp;

This brief but fascinating story will appeal to bibliophiles and be useful for assignments on European saints and Celtic history.&nbsp; There is a helpful author&#x2019;s note, a sample of Roman alphabet, and detailed sketches of bookmaking and a leather boat.&nbsp;

Great color / black and white illustrations throughout. Georgette Heyer was a fine historical novelist. &#34;A bestseller for 50 years, she never made a public appearance and never gave an interview.&#34; Here is her story, and it tells of a brilliant woman who, in all ways, took no prisoners. A worthy book about a worthy author.</p><p><p>Author of over 20 novels, <b>Jane Aiken Hodge </b>worked as a journalist, reviewer, and civil servant before her death in 2009. Born in the United States, and raised in England, she studied English at Oxford and then received her master's degree from Harvard. She considered Heyer's work to be of high literary merit.</p><p>FOREWORD</p> <p>Georgette Heyer was an intensely private person. A best-seller all her life without the aid of publicity, she made no appearances, never gave an interview, and only answered fan letters herself if they made an interesting historical point. Having scored an instant success with The Black Moth at the age of nineteen under her own name, Georgette Heyer, she experimented with a pseudonym, Stella Martin, for her third book, published by Mills &amp; Boon, then achieved a permanent alias when she married Ronald Rougier at twenty-three. From then on, Georgette Heyer wrote the best-sellers, while Mrs Ronald Rougier led the deeply private life. She never talked about her background and early years, giving only the barest facts of her life in eighteen lines of Who's Who. After her death, A. S. Byatt, the critic and novelist, wrote an invaluable long memorial piece for the Sunday Times, based on interviews with her husband, her friend Carola Oman and her two good publisher friends, A. S. Frere of Heinemann and Max Reinhardt of The Bodley Head. This is the only source for much of the information about her early life, about which she herself never talked. I have been able to supplement it by talking to her surviving family and friends (her husband and Carola Oman are now both dead) and by reference to her letters and to the four early novels she later suppressed.</p> <p>Her own invariable answer, when asked about her private life, was to refer the questioner back to her books. You will find me, she said, in my work. So should one now, almost ten years after her death, try to look behind the curtain of privacy in which she shrouded herself? My first instinct, when I started work on this book, was to concentrate entirely on the work, merely giving the barest facts of her life as a foreword. Then I began to talk to the people who knew her, and to read her letters. Everyone who knew her had loved or respected her, and they all seemed glad that a book should be written about her. But her own letters settled the question. She may have been a private person socially, almost a recluse, but on paper she was a compulsive communicator. And she wrote, her son says, just as she talked. Her letters to her publishers are full of sidelights on her own life and pungent comments on the world at large. They confirm, in short, her friends' unanimous description of her as shy on the surface, but a formidable, positive person underneath, with strong views and a great sense of style.</p> <p>It hardly sounds the description of a purveyor of romantic froth. But in fact, for those with eyes to see, the strong character is there in her books, even in the lightest and most frivolous of them, and an awareness of the kind of person she was adds a new dimension to one's enjoyment of them, or, perhaps, helps to explain just why one does enjoy them. She may have been a compulsive writer, but she was also an immensely skilled and meticulous craftswoman. She did her best to conceal her high standards and stern moral code behind the mask of romantic comedy, and succeeded, so far as her great fan public was concerned. But she had a smaller audience, among dons and journalists, among her husband's legal associates, among intelligent women everywhere, and even among feminists, who enjoyed the romantic syllabub all the more because they were aware of the hard core of realism underneath.</p> <p>Naturally, it was the ravening fan public that made its voice most clearly heard during her lifetime, and its adulation served both to drive her further into herself and to put off readers who might have enjoyed her as they do Jane Austen or even Ivy Compton-Burnett, a favourite of hers. There is a terrible snobbery in the average intellectual reaction to her work. It is not everyone who has given her name to a type of novel, and it is unfortunate that that name should tend to provoke an uninformed, unjustified sneer. My aim in this book is to try to redress the balance by giving a feeling of her and of her work, as far as possible through her own words in the extensive correspondence which her publishers have kindly made available to me and her letters to friends. Some of her friends, though happy to talk about Georgette Heyer, have felt that she would not have wished her letters shown or quoted, and this is a feeling that must be respected. Her letters to her publishers, on the other hand, are part of the professional world she enjoyed, and unless otherwise indicated all the quotations in this book are from them. </p> <p>Unfortunately, hardly any letters survive from before the 1940s, when she herself was in her forties and had been a best-seller for years. By this time she was taking a sadly deprecatory line about her own work. Speaking of Friday's Child in 1943 she says: 'Spread the glad tidings that it will not disappoint Miss Heyer's many admirers. Judging from the letters I've received from obviously feeble-minded persons who do so wish I could write another These Old Shades, it ought to sell like hot cakes. I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense, but it's unquestionably good escapist literature, and I think I should rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter, or recovering from flu. Its period detail is good; my husband says it's witty &#x2013; and without going to these lengths, I will say that it is very good fun.'</p> <p>The statement sums up the problem she had with her readers. The dons and lawyers mostly kept quiet. The more vociferous of the fans tended to like the wrong books for the wrong reasons. They kept asking for swashbuckling romance when she was writing neat romantic comedy in the vein of Congreve and Sheridan. The reviewers, too, failed to appreciate the style and craftsmanship of her work as it developed into what would be known as 'the Georgette Heyer.' It is no wonder that she turned against publicity of any kind. As well as the letters, Georgette Heyer left the unfinished typescript of about half of what she had planned as a serious mediaeval book, since published as My Lord John; a remarkable research library of some thousand volumes (now unfortunately dispersed); and a small but highly significant collection of papers, to which her son has kindly given me access. There was no attic full of carefully hoarded manuscripts and first drafts. A flat-dweller since 1939, she found the proliferating copies of her published books problem enough without indulging in the sentiment of keeping old papers, however fascinating they might have proved to posterity. She saved a few reviews, and one fan letter. It was from a woman who had kept herself and her cell-mates sane through twelve years in a Romanian political prison by telling the story of Friday's Child over and over again. </p></p><h2>Daredevil Back in Black 4: Identity</h2><p>There's a bounty on DAREDEVIL's head big enough to bring out every contract killer in New York City.

Juan knows little of the interior life of his father Ranz; but when Juan marries, he begins to consider the past anew, and begins to ponder what he doesn't really want to know. Secrecy&#x2015;its possible convenience, its price, and even its civility&#x2015;hovers throughout the novel. <em>A Heart So White</em> becomes a sort of anti-detective story of human nature. Intrigue; the sins of the father; the fraudulent and the genuine; marriage and strange repetitions of violence: Mar�as elegantly sends shafts of inquisitory light into shadows and on to the costs of ambivalence. ("My hands are of your colour; but I shame/To wear a heart so white"&#x2015;Shakespeare's <em>Macbeth</em>.)</p><p><p><strong>Javier Mar�as</strong> is an award-winning Spanish novelist. He is also a translator and columnist, as well as the current king of Redonda. He was born in Madrid in 1951 and published his first novel at the age of nineteen.

At the heart of that campaign lies one man: Gerry Adams. From the outbreak of the troubles to the present day, he has been an immensely influential figure. The most compelling question about the IRA is: how did a man who condoned atrocities that resulted in huge numbers of civilian deaths also become the guiding light behind the peace process? Moloney&#39;s book is now updated to encompass the anxious and uneasy peace that has prevailed to 2007.</p><p>Ed Moloney has been Northern Ireland Editor of both the Irish Times and the Sunday Tribune. He has written for a wide range of newspapers and magazines in Ireland, the UK and the USA. In 1999 he was Irish Journalist of the Year. He currently lives in New York.<p>Within minutes the <i>Eksund</i> was surrounded and boarded by armed French customs men. Within hours a shocked and disbelieving public in Ireland and Britain would hear the news of the failure of this extraordinary smuggling venture. A few weeks later and the full scope of the IRA's operations would be made public; everyone would know that the organization now had some 150 tons of explosives and modern weaponry, delivered earlier and safely stored away in secret dumps throughout Ireland. But the greatest secret of them all, that the <i>Eksund</i> had been betrayed, was to remain sealed.</p><br><p>There was no time to repair the timing unit. The spotter plane had again flown overhead, and in the distance the crew could see motor launches speeding toward them. The net was obviously closing, Cleary watched the scene with a sense of grim satisfaction; his instincts had been right.</p><br><p>Cleary knew that the TPU must have been tampered with after the <i>Eksund</i> had left Tripoli harbor and not before. The IRA man had made up the mechanism himself before sailing and had linked it to detonators fixed into slabs of Semtex not long after leaving the dock. The TPU had been in perfect working order. He had double-checked to make sure.</p><br><p>Cleary never got as far as even connecting the device. Instead the realization of treachery forced a number of thoughts to flash through his head, as he later told IRA colleagues. The British must have known about their plans all along, and soon the media would know as well. But the question that brought a cold sweat to his brow concerned the identity of the traitor. There was certainly a collaborator on board, but was there another one, someone back in Ireland who had betrayed the <i>Eksund</i> and its precious cargo?</p><br><p>A cursory glance at the bomb mechanism told Cleary that the plan would have to be scrapped; the firing unit for the explosives had been sabotaged, its wiring damaged beyond repair. The device, known as a timing power unit (TPU), was simple to operate and safe enough for a child to use, but it was just as easy to put out of commission. Whoever had neutralized Cleary's bombs would not have needed much training.</p><br><p>The IRA man had chosen a hole known as Deep Hurd in which to scuttle the <i>Eksund</i>. The plan was to sink the vessel and then head in the dinghy for the Brittany coast, after which the crew would catch a ferry back to Ireland without the authorities' ever knowing about the IRA's audacious plan. That was when he discovered that a traitor had wrecked his plan.</p><br><p>The <i>Eksund</i>'s ballast tanks had already been filled with water in preparation for scuttling. Cleary had crafted Semtex bombs that were just large enough to make holes in the vessel's skin but not so large that the noise of the explosions would attract attention. French forensic experts later calculated that the <i>Eksund</i> would have sunk within seconds.</p><br><p>Cleary had spent most of his adult life in the Provisional IRA and had become one of the organization's most skilled bomb makers. From the Tallaght area of Dublin, a vast sprawling working-class housing estate on the southwest edge of the city, he rose in the IRA engineering department, that part of the IRA which had the job of manufacturing homemade explosives and devising the organization's impressive range of improvised and home-made weaponry. Although well known to the Irish Special Branch, he had managed to avoid imprisonment. Only once had the authorities come near to pinning him, and that was eight years earlier, in 1977, when he beat a charge of making bombs in Kildare. By the time he was appointed to oversee the <i>Eksund</i> voyage, Cleary had advanced to the top of the IRA's military elite and was in charge of its vital engineering department. He was a natural choice to head the <i>Eksund</i> operation.</p><br><p>The colorful Dublin businessman Adrian Hopkins, who had found and purchased the <i>Eksund</i>, captained the vessel as he had the two other ships used by the IRA to facilitate the Libyan venture. The IRA had provided two sailors to assist him, James Coll and James Doherty, both of them County Donegal trawler men. Hopkins's friend and sometime business partner Henry Cairns, the man suspected of having introduced Hopkins to the IRA, was along for the ride.</p><br>As he assembled the crew on the top deck to prepare the inflatable dinghy that would take them ashore, Cleary started the process of triggering the timing device that would set off the bombs and slowly sink the <i>Eksund</i>. This was the job Cleary had been chosen for.<p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<br><p>The steering problem struck again on October 27. The crew tried to make repairs but with no success, and the <i>Eksund</i> drifted closer and closer to the French coast. The next day Cleary realized the mission was doomed and took the fateful decision to scuttle the ship and sink its precious freight before it ran aground. His orders had been precise: on no account must the British learn of the IRA's arms-smuggling operation; the very outcome of the war depended on secrecy being preserved.</p><p>As the <i>Eksund</i> passed the Brittany coast and veered left for Ireland, the boat ran into a different sort of trouble. The fifty-year-old vessel, which had shipped grain most of her life, had endured a difficult journey out to Malta. At one stage the vessel had to dock in England for engine repairs, and at another point the steering failed.</p><br><p>Within hours of setting sail, however, the IRA commander's doubts returned. A plane flew directly over the <i>Eksund</i>, and Cleary suspected it was an RAF spotter aircraft. Every day of the voyage thereafter a similar aircraft would perform the same maneuver. There seemed little doubt that someone was keeping a very close eye on the Eksund's progress. Off Gibraltar the plane swooped down so low that the pilot was visible. Cleary grew more and more nervous.</p><br><p>The Libyans took precautions. The <i>Eksund</i> was loaded at nighttime to reduce the chances of being spotted, and the boat was moored in the military section of the dockside for added security. But even so, Cleary was glad when the <i>Eksund</i> finally weighed anchor.</p><br><p>Although the nearby British embassy was closed, emptied of its staff following a major diplomatic row with Qaddafi, everyone, IRA and Libyans alike, assumed that the British had left their spies behind. Some could easily be mingling with the crowds down at the harbor or at the nearby souk where traders bought and sold gold and silver and exchanged gossip.</p><br><p>The Libyan harbor was a dangerous place for IRA men on a mission to smuggle weapons. The Tripoli docks were regularly jammed with ships unloading consumer goods, as a result of a massive oil-financed consumer boom; the bustling labor force was a mixture of Arabs drawn from nearly every country in North Africa and European expatriates lured by the high salaries offered in this former Italian colony.</p><br><p>This operation had to be handled differently. The <i>Eksund</i>'s cargo was as large as the four other shipments put together. The sheer size and bulk of weaponry involved meant that the loading process would be lengthy, and that made an operation at sea simply out of the question. With the CIA and other Western intelligence agencies taking an ever-greater interest in Libyan affairs, the chances of being spotted by satellite surveillance were too great. The <i>Eksund</i>'s manifest was breathtaking: 1,000 Romanian-made AK-47 automatic rifles, a million rounds of ammunition, 430 grenades, 12 rocket-propelled grenade launchers with ample supplies of grenades and rockets, 12 heavy Russian DHSK machine guns, over 50 SAM-7 ground-to-air missiles capable of downing British army helicopters, 2,000 electric detonators and 4,700 fuses, 106 millimeter cannons, general-purpose machine guns, anti-tank missile launchers, flame throwers, and two tons of the powerful Czech-made explosive Semtex. With a cargo like that to load there was no option; the work had to be done in Tripoli itself.</p><br><p>Cleary's fears had been growing ever since the <i>Eksund</i> had left the Libyan capital, Tripoli, some two weeks earlier, as he later told an IRA inquiry in messages smuggled from a French prison. The Panamanian-registered vessel had been loaded with some 150 tons of modern, sophisticated weaponry at Tripoli dockside by sailors from Colonel Qaddafi's small naval service on October 13 and 14, 1987. Although that part of the operation had gone smoothly, Cleary was uneasy. This was the fifth trip since August 1985, but the four earlier cargoes, amounting in total to another 150 tons of weapons and explosives, had been safely and secretly transferred to IRA boats from a Libyan vessel off Malta, well out at sea and far from the sight of hostile, prying eyes.</p><br><p>There was only one thought in Gabriel Cleary's mind, and it chilled him. As he checked the firing unit linked to the twelve explosive charges placed beneath the <i>Eksund</i>'s waterline, the signs of sabotage were unmistakable. With a growing sense of horror the IRA's director of engineering realized that the most ambitious gunrunning plot ever in the IRA's long war with Britain had been betrayed.</p></p><h2>Utopia&#39;s Debris: Selected Essays</h2><p>Gary Indiana is one of America's leading cultural critics&#x2014;a public intellectual who has written key essays on every aspect of American culture. <i>Utopia's Debris</i> comprises selections of his very best work, revealing him to be an enormously acute, frequently scabrous, and always brilliant observer of the best and worst America has to offer.<p>His writings range from popular culture&#x2014;trash novels, architectural wonders and horrors&#x2014;to appreciations of the best of modern literature, art, and cinema.

Praise for the God who was king over all creation. Honest prayers of confession. In these pages, Miller introduces us to six types of Celtic prayer that can connect us to God more deeply by helping us pray out of the circumstances and uncertainties of our own life. &#34;This book proposes a kind of prayer that can end our amputated feelings of separateness from God,&#34; says Miller. What was true for the Celts is still true for us: &#34;Hunger for Christ keeps us talking to God till our separation is swallowed up in our unending togetherness with him.&#34; As rich as the faith they describe, these pages lead us on an ancient path that gives guidance for present and future prayers, until the day the Celts longed for, when all separation is gone and we live forever in the presence of God.</p><p>Calvin Miller (M.Div., Ph.D., Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary) is currently a professor at Beeson Divinity School. The author of more than forty books and many more articles, Miller is also well-known as a poet, artist, novelist and speaker. His latest works include Preaching (Baker), O Shepherd Where Art Thou?

World War One began on horseback, with generals employing bayonet charges to gain ground, and ended with attacks resembling the Nazi <i>blitzkriegs</i>. The scale of devastation was unlike anything the world had seen before: Fourteen million combatants died, a further twenty million were wounded, and four empires were destroyed. Even the victors' empires were fatally damaged.<p>An overwhelming disaster from which the world is still recovering, World War One can seem baffling in its complexity. But now Norman Stone, one of world's greatest military historians, has composed a dazzlingly lucid and succinct history of the conflict. Stone has distilled a lifetime of teaching, arguing, and thinking into this brisk and opinionated account of the fundamental tragedy of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><b>Norman Stone</b> has taught at universities in Britain and Turkey. He was Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford from 1984 to 1997 and is currently Professor of History at Bilkent University. His books include <i>The Eastern Front 1914&#x2013;1917</i>, which won the Wolfson Prize, and <i>Europe Transformed</i>. He lives in Ankara, Istanbul, and Oxford.Stone is as unconventional as he is brilliant, and this provocative interpretation of the Great War combines impressive command of the literature with a telling eye for relevant facts and a sensitive ear for telling epigrams. Stone presents a Europe that in 1914 bestrode the world like the proverbial colossus. Four years later, the continent faced a spectrum of disasters: shattered economies, shattered societies, shattered lives and shattered illusions. Stone demonstrates the contingent nature of the war's outbreak and analyzes the continued failure to achieve decision on the Western Front until 1917. Stone specializes in Great War Russia, does a first-rate job of presenting the consequences of the collapse of four empires: Hapsburg, German, tsarist and Ottoman. He challenges current interpretations of the postwar treaties, presenting them as a list of failures. The attempt to integrate the world economy collapsed. The postwar expansion of colonial empires proved ephemeral. The League of Nations declined into irrelevance.

Reprint.</p><p>From 1610, when the Spanish founded the city of Santa Fe, to the 1860s, when the railroad brought unprecedented changes: here is the full, fascinating story of the great Santa Fe Trail which ran between Missouri and Kansas and New Mexico--a lifeline to and from the Southwest for more than two centuries.<br>Drawing from letters, journals, expedition reports, business records, and newspaper stories, David Dary--one of our foremost historians of the Old West--brings to life the people who laid down the trail and opened commerce with Spanish America: Native Americans and mountain men, traders, trappers, and freighters, surveyors and soldiers, men and women of many different nationalities. Their firsthand accounts let us experience up close the spectacular scenery; the details of camping out in both friendly and hostile Indian territory; the constant danger from natural disasters or sudden attack; the hardworking, often maverick men who were employed on the wagon trains; the pleasures and entertainments at the southern end of the journey.<br>The book makes clear how in the early years trade started and stopped at the whim of the Spanish, and how the trail finally grew and prospered, bringing the settlement of new towns and the creation of new wealth along the route. We also learn how the rapid spread of the railroads across the country inexorably replaced the long caravans of mule- and ox-drawn wagons, and the way of life they represented.<br>With his comprehensive knowledge and his exceptional storytelling skills, David Dary has given us a vivid re-creation of an important time and place in American history."Commendably lucid . . . a wonderful job of resurrecting the past � For anyone wishing to visit this remarkable region up close and personal."-JoAnn Levy, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"The story of the Western frontier is to the American imagination what Hector and Achilles were to the Greeks . . .

In February 1945, while he was captain of a reconnaissance battery of the Soviet Army, he was arrested and sentenced to an eight-year term in a labor camp and permanent internal exile, which was cut short by Khrushchev's reforms, allowing him to return from Kazakhstan to Central Russia in 1956. Although permitted to publish <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> in 1962--which remained his only full-length work to have appeared in his homeland until 1990--Solzhenitsyn was by 1969 expelled from the Writers' Union. The publication in the West of his other novels and, in particular, of <i>The Gulag Archipelago,</i> brought retaliation from the authorities. In 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested, stripped of his Soviet citizenship, and forcibly flown to Frankfurt. Solzhenitsyn and his wife and children moved to the United States in 1976. In September 1991, the Soviet government dismissed treason charges against him; Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia in 1994.

Though he contracted tuberculosis during the five years of the term he eventually served, he was able during this period to draft extensive outlines for future writings, including the family tree of the protagonist of <i>Houses</i>. After studying psychology at the University of Belgrade, Peki&#x107; worked as a screenwriter, collaborating on more than twenty scripts, among them <i>The Fourteenth Day</i>, which represented Yugoslavia at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. His first novel, <i>The Time of Miracles</i>, was published in 1965. In 1970, <i>Houses</i> won the prestigious NIN Award for best Serbian novel, and Peki&#x107; managed to obtain a passport and emigrate to London. Living as an expatriate he continued to write novels and advocate for democratic reform. In all, Peki&#x107; would write more than thirty works of fiction and nonfiction and saw some two dozen of his plays produced for the stage.

Following the collapse of Communism, he returned periodically to Serbia, finally helping to form the new Serbian Democratic Party in 1990 and clashing with security forces at an anti-Milo&#x161;evi&#x107; rally in 1991.

This is a funny collection of connected stories and a portrait of Jane, a woman manoeuvring her way through love, sex and relationships.</p><p>Jane Rosenal, the narrator of <i>The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing</i>, is wise beyond her years. Not that that's saying much--since none of her elders, with the exception of her father, is particularly wise. At the age of 14, Jane watches her brother and his new girlfriend, searching for clues for how to fall in love, but by the end of the summer she's trying to figure out how not to <i>fail</i> in love. At twice that age, Jane quickly internalizes <i>How to Meet and Marry Mr. Right</i>, even though that retro manual is ruining her chances at happiness. In the intervening years, Melissa Bank's heroine struggles at love and work. The former often seems indistinguishable from the latter, and her experiences in book publishing inspire little in the way of affection. As Jane announces in "The Worst Thing a Suburban Girl Could Imagine": "I'd been a rising star at H----- until Mimi Howlett, the new executive editor, decided I was just the lights of an airplane."<p> Bank's first collection has a beautiful, true arc, and all the sophistication and control her heroine could ever desire. In "The Floating House," Jane and her boyfriend, Jamie, visit his ex-girlfriend in St. Croix, and right from the start she can't stop mimicking her beautiful competitor, in a notably idiotic fashion. "I'm like one of those animals that imitates its predators to survive," she realizes--one of several thousand of Bank's ruefully funny phrases. But even as Jane clowns around, desperately trying to keep up appearances, she is so hyperaware it hurts. Again and again, the author explores the dichotomy between life as it happens and the rehearsed anecdote, the preferred outcome. In <i>The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing</i>, even suburban quiet has "nothing to do with peace." Bank's much-anticipated debut merits all its buzz and, more to the point, transcends it. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Melissa Bank has had several stories published in US magazines.

When 14-year-old Homer watches Sputnik fly over his home town, his life is changed forever. His group of &#34;Rocket Boy&#34; friends launch their own rocket into space, and unite a town and a family.</p><p>Inspired by Werner von Braun and his Cape Canaveral team, 14-year-old Homer Hickam decided in 1957 to build his own rockets. They were his ticket out of Coalwood, West Virginia, a mining town that everyone knew was dying--everyone except Sonny's father, the mine superintendent and a company man so dedicated that his family rarely saw him. Hickam's smart, iconoclastic mother wanted her son to become something more than a miner and, along with a female science teacher, encouraged the efforts of his grandiosely named Big Creek Missile Agency. He grew up to be a NASA engineer and his memoir of the bumpy ride toward a gold medal at the National Science Fair in 1960--an unprecedented honor for a miner's kid--is rich in humor as well as warm sentiment. Hickam vividly evokes a world of close communal ties in which a storekeeper who sold him saltpeter warned, "Listen, rocket boy. This stuff can blow you to kingdom come." Hickam is candid about the deep disagreements and tensions in his parents' marriage, even as he movingly depicts their quiet loyalty to each other. The portrait of his ultimately successful campaign to win his aloof father's respect is equally affecting. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"[T]horoughly charming....Hickam builds a story of overcoming obstacles that is worthy of Frank Capra...[in its]...eloquent evocation of a lost time and place."<br>--Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>A Conspiracy of Violence A Thomas Chaloner Mystery</h2><p><p>Susanna Gregory, author of the Matthew Bartholomew series of medieval mysteries, has created another compelling fictional detective set in Restoration London.</p><p>--------------------------------------------</p><p><b>The first adventure in the Thomas Chaloner series.</b><br><b></b><br><b>The dour days of Cromwell are over. </b></p><p>Charles II is well established at White Hall Palace, his mistress at hand in rooms over the Holbein bridge, the heads of some of the regicides on public display.

Amid England's worsening relations with Holland, Chaloner's Dutch girlfriend, Metje, incriminates him, and he finds himself at an "important crossroads," with options of spying for the king, hunting rumored treasure buried in the Tower or returning home to Buckinghamshire to live quietly. Some obvious clues and implausible coincidences make the resolution of his many challenges less than satisfying in this overly complicated mix of history, suspense and romance. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It committed Britain to supporting the establishment in Palestine of &#x201c;a National Home for the Jewish people,&#x201d; and its reverberations continue to be felt to this day. Now the entire fascinating story of the document is revealed in this impressive work of modern history.<br><br>With new material retrieved from historical archives, scholar Jonathan Schneer recounts in dramatic detail the public and private battles in the early 1900s for a small strip of land in the Middle East, battles that started when the governing Ottoman Empire took Germany&#x2019;s side in World War I. The Balfour Declaration paints an indelible picture of how Arab nationalists, backed by Britain, fought for their future as Zionists in England battled diplomatically for influence. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to either side or even to most members of the British government, Prime Minister David Lloyd George was telling Turkey that she could keep her flag flying over the disputed territory if only she would agree to a separate peace.<br><br>The key players in this watershed moment are rendered here in nuanced and detailed relief: Sharif Hussein, the Arab leader who secretly sought British support; Chaim Weizmann, Zionist hero, the folksmensch who charmed British high society; T. E. Lawrence, the legendary &#x201c;super cerebral&#x201d; British officer who &#x201c;set the desert on fire&#x201d; for the Arabs; Basil Zaharoff, the infamous arms dealer who was Britain&#x2019;s most important back channel to the Turks; and the other generals and prime ministers, soldiers and negotiators, who shed blood and cut deals to grab or give away the precious land.<br><br>A book crucial to understanding the Middle East as it is today, The Balfour Declaration is a rich and remarkable achievement, a riveting volume about the ancient faiths and timeless treacheries that continue to drive global events.</p><p>Jonathan Schneer, a specialist in modern British history, is a professor at Georgia Tech's School of History, Technology, and Society.

Rather, if anything, the reverse. A century ago it was merely a strip of territory running along the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The remote, sleepy, backward, sparsely populated southwestern bit of Syria was still home to foxes, jackals, hyenas, wildcats, wolves, even cheetahs and leopards in its most unsettled parts. Loosely governed from Jerusalem in the south and from Beirut in the north by agents of the Ottoman Empire, Palestine&#x2019;s borders were vague. To the east it merged with the Jordanian plateau, to the south with the Arabian deserts, and to the north with the gray mountain masses of Lebanon. And it was small: Fewer than two hundred miles long and fifty miles wide, it was not much bigger than present-day Massachusetts (to put it in an American context) and about the size of Wales (to put it in the British).<br><br>The strip of land, resting mainly upon limestone, was devoid of coal, iron, copper, silver, or gold deposits and lacked oil, but it was happily porous (&#x201c;calcareous,&#x201d; the geologists said), meaning that it was capable of absorbing moisture whenever the heavens should open, which they might do, especially when the wind came from the north. When it came from the east, however, as it frequently did in May and October, the wind was a malign enervating force. It was a furnace-blast sirocco in hot weather and a numbing chill in cold. The two mountain ranges that ran in rough parallel the length of the country from north to south could not block it. The western range, which includes &#x201c;the Mount of the Amorites&#x201d; of the Book of Deuteronomy, runs between the Jordan Valley (to its east) and the maritime plain (to its west). The eastern edge of this range is an escarpment that drops (precipitously in places) to the fabled Jordan River below. The second or eastern range of hills, which include the mountains of Moab, Judea, and Galilee, is a continuation of a chain that begins in Lebanon and reaches southward into Jordan. To its west lies the river valley; to its east is a desert plateau. In the north of the country the mountains are quite tall: Mount Hermon rises more than 9,200 feet above sea level. (People ski there in winter now.) To the south the mountains are typically half as high, and the surrounding landscape is bleak, empty, and inhospitable.<br><br>For such a tiny land, Palestine contains extraordinary topographical contrasts. The Jordan River runs southward along a descending valley floor, passing some seventy miles from the clear waters of the Sea of Galilee, where the surrounding hills and fields are relatively green, welcoming, and fruitful. It empties into the brackish bitter Dead Sea, thirteen hundred feet below sea level, where the landscape is barren, freezing during winter, broiling in summer. In the Dead Sea area the Jordan Valley has never been cultivated, although at the turn of the twentieth century the wandering Bedouins might camp there. Even they, however, would move on during the hottest months, when temperatures scale 120 degrees Fahrenheit or higher and the land opens in cracks and fissures.<br><br>Elsewhere in Palestine, however, life flourished. &#x201c;It drinketh of the rain of heaven,&#x201d; Moses is supposed to have said of his &#x201c;Promised Land,&#x201d; and although it did not drink deep (rainfall averaged 28 to 32 inches annually, except in the south, where 6 inches marked a good year), and it rarely drank at all from March until November, nevertheless it drank sufficiently. Parts of the country were nearly luxuriant. In 1869 even that American innocent abroad, Samuel Clemens, whose wonderfully dyspeptic view of Palestine is legendary, could refer without irony to groves of lemon trees, &#x201c;cool, shady, hung with fruit,&#x201d; by the village of Shunem near &#x201c;Little Hermon,&#x201d; and to &#x201c;breezy glades of thorn and oak,&#x201d; south of the Sea of Galilee near Mount Tabor. A horseman riding the Hauran plateau, east of the eastern mountain range, could view unbroken wheat fields extending to the horizon on every side. A British visitor to the Circassian village of Gerasa was reminded &#x201c;of a Scotch glen, though the hills are not so high nor the land so barren.&#x201d; Local markets sold a diverse range of fruits and vegetables, some of remarkable size. &#x201c;We have cauliflowers that measure at least a foot across, and water-melons hardly to be spanned by a grown person&#x2019;s arms . . . grapes in clusters from three to four feet in length . . . We have in their season [also] . . . apricots, nectarines, plums, damsons, quince, mulberries, figs, lemons, oranges, prickly pear, pomegranates and many kinds of nuts.&#x201d; In spring the countryside (some of it) ran riot with wildflowers: &#x201c;anemones . . . hyacinths, ranunculus, narcissus, honeysuckle, daisies, buttercups, cistus.&#x201d; The writer lists a dozen additional varieties and claims to have seen &#x201c;many more whose names elude me now.&#x201d; Such reports may have been exaggerated&#x2014;other European visitors insisted the land was no cornucopia. But one hundred years ago the countryside was far from being wasteland.<br><br>As many as 700,000 people lived there then, although figures vary and are imprecise. Many were descended from the Canaanites or Philistines (who gave the land its name) or from the Arabs, even from the ancient Hebrews. They spoke Arabic, and most of them may be termed Arabs, although commonly only nomadic Bedouins were referred to as &#x201c;pure&#x201d; Arabs. The majority were Sunni Muslims, who accepted the caliphs as Muhammad&#x2019;s legitimate successors, but some were Shiite Muslims, who believed that Ali, son-in-law of Muhammad, originated the true line of succession. There were as well Druze and other Christians, some of them European or of European descent, and Jews, some of whom were also European transplants or of European origin. Flocks of Christian tourists, thousands every year, came to visit the holy land, and even greater numbers of Muslim pilgrims passed through on their annual trek to Mecca.<br><br>Of the total permanent population, only a tiny fraction were rich. This fortunate minority derived their wealth in one way or another from ownership of land, but they resided in the largest towns; their well-appointed large brick houses were whitewashed with lime and built around courtyards. The middle class, composed of well-to-do bankers, merchants, and clerics, as well as a handful of professionals and local traders, lived more modestly in the towns and villages, in stone houses well adapted for keeping out the heat of the sun. The vast majority of the inhabitants, however, were poor. Many lived in tiny isolated villages, set on hilltops within high walls, a reminder of the times, not long past, when safety demanded such protection from Bedouin marauders. In northern and central Palestine the typical village home was a square mud-plastered, whitewashed hut one story high with a straw roof. In the south it was a rough straw shelter or, for the semi-nomads based there part of the year, merely a tent. Inside these dwellings one might see only a few mats, baskets, a sheepskin, and some earthenware and wooden vessels.<br><br>Most villagers were fellahin, peasants. Within the village walls they sometimes worked in gardens or orchards or vineyards, for themselves or for their more wealthy neighbors; more commonly, they worked in the surrounding fields and pastures as sharecroppers for one of the great landowning families; or for the imperial Turkish state, which owned or controlled much Palestinian land; or for the villages themselves, since some villages owned land and periodically allocated it to residents for cultivation under a system called musha. Outsiders were impressed by the fellah&#x2019;s industry. &#x201c;He abominates absence from his fields,&#x201d; observed one. And the fellah had a reputation for generosity, &#x201c;such as his poverty allows.&#x201d;<br><br>Outside the towns and villages Bedouin nomads roamed ceaselessly, oblivious to boundaries and borders that, anyway, were vague to all. These &#x201c;dwellers in the open land,&#x201d; or &#x201c;people of the tent&#x201d; as they called themselves, were the &#x201c;pure Arabs&#x201d; romanticized by certain Europeans for their swashbuckling behavior, independence, and egalitarianism. Divided among clans and tribes who occasionally made ritualistic and not very bloody war upon one another, the Bedouins might prey upon caravans and travelers, whom they viewed as fair game unless protected by previous agreement with a local sheikh, in which case the traveler&#x2019;s safety was inviolate. But robbery was only an interlude; mainly the Bedouin tribes wandered the countryside with their camels, sheep, goats, and donkeys in more or less regular patterns and rhythms according to the weather and needs of their livestock. Their material possessions were few. Their tents were little more than a few coverings of coarse goat or camel hair dyed black and spread over two or more small poles; on striking camp, they could quickly load their few possessions onto their beasts. When on the move, Bedouin tribes tended to skirt villages and to give towns an even wider berth. But this was a recent development: Within living memory Bedouins had raided them periodically.<br><br>Among the large towns of Palestine, Jerusalem was biggest and most important, containing sites holy to Jews, Muslims, and Christians alike. In 1911 its 60,000 inhabitants included 7,000 Muslims, 9,000 Christians, and 40,000 Jews. The city stood on a rocky plateau, 2,500 feet above sea level, overlooking hills and valleys except to the east, where the Mount of Olives looms 200 feet higher still. Peering down from that perch to the city below, one would have seen timber and red tiles among the vaulted white stone roofs of the more ancient structures: These hotels, hospices, hospitals, and schools were mainly the work of Christian missio...</p><h2>The American Heritage Children&#39;s Dictionary</h2><p>AH-9780547212555 This brand-new edition of the best-selling American Heritage Children&#39;s Dictionary covers all the vocabulary young readers need today.

Pulitzer Prize-winner Jacke Miles gives us a deeply probing, revelatory portrait of the world&#x2019;s second largest, fastest-growing and perhaps most tragically misunderstood religion. In doing so, Miles illuminates what is unique about Allah, His teachings, and His resolutely merciful temperament, and he thereby reveals that which is false, distorted, or simply absent from the popular conception of the heart of Islam. <br><br> So, too, does Miles uncover the spiritual and scriptural continuity of the Islamic tradition with those of Judaism and Christianity, and the deep affinities among the three by setting passages from the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Qur&#x2019;an side by side. In the spirit of his two previous books, <i>God</i> and <i>Christ</i>, and with his characteristic sensitivity, perspicacity and prodigious command of the subject, Miles calls for us all to read another&#x2019;s scriptures with the same understanding and accommodating eye that we turn upon our own.</p><p>JACK MILES pursued religious studies at Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome, and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and holds a doctorate in Near Eastern languages from Harvard University.

The book before you&#x2014;about God in Muslim scripture, the Qur&#x2019;an&#x2014;is the third in the series. I am a Christian, a practicing Episcopalian, but I approach God in all three of these books not directly but only through the respective scriptures of the three traditions. I write, moreover, not as a religious believer but only as a literary critic writing quite consciously for an audience crowded with unbelievers.<br><br> What this means is that I approach the scriptures not through belief but through a suspension of disbelief. Suspension of disbelief is a notion introduced into English literary criticism by the nineteenth-century poet and critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge. It is by the temporary suspension of disbelief that any of us is able to &#x201c;let go&#x201d; and enjoy a novel, a film, or a television series like <i>Game of Thrones</i> on its own terms. When we go to the movies on a summer night and see a romantic comedy, we do not object as the film goes along that the lovers on screen are not real lovers but only two actors pretending to be in love. We disbelieve in their ultimate reality, of course, but for the duration of the film, we &#x201c;allow&#x201d; them to be real. We play along. <br><br> You can play along in the same way even when a literary character is divine. Not long ago, for a course I taught, I had occasion to re-read Homer&#x2019;s <i>Iliad,</i> this time in the wonderful Robert Fagles translation. The Greek god Zeus is a major character in that epic&#x2014;the greatest of the Olympian gods. I do not belief that Zeus exists, but for the duration of my reading, I willingly played along with Homer, allowing Zeus to shape the course of the <i>Iliad</i> as powerfully as he does. <br><br> As a Christian, by a kind of reversal, I can temporarily suspend my belief that the God of the Bible is indeed much more than a literary character and take him as no more than that for the duration of an exercise in literary appreciation. Just as I can go to St. Peter&#x2019;s Basilica in Rome on a Sunday to worship and then go back on a Monday to study its art and architecture, so I can hear Christ&#x2019;s Sermon on the Mount on Sunday as a part of my worship and then study it on Monday as relevant data about Christ as a literary character. The two exercises are different, deeply so, but they are not mutually exclusive and can be mutually stimulating.<br><br> Literary criticism, beginning in this way with the aesthetic experience of a work of literature, is different from literary history or historical criticism. Historical criticism is concerned with such questions as: Who wrote this work? When did he write it? Why did he write it? For what audience did he write it? Or did she write it? Or they? Was it originally in the language in which we now read it? What sources did they draw on, if any, as they wrote it, or is it truly an original creation? Has it been revised over time? Is it in circulation in more than one form? If so, which form is best? Is it perhaps the redacted combination of more than one version of itself? What has been its reception over time? Has it been translated? Has it ever been suppressed?<br><br> And so forth. Such questions&#x2014;legitimate as they are, fascinating as they can be, and endless as they also are&#x2014;are not the subject matter of this book. A scholar may have answered dozens of such questions about a given work of literature, indeed spent a lifetime answering them, without ever quite engaging the work in itself, as an aesthetic creation separable to some extent, as all great works are, from the time and place and circumstances in which it arose. Historical criticism need not interfere with literary appreciation, and the two can often be symbiotic, but the two are even then distinguishable.<br><br> In what follows, we will consider a cast of iconic characters who appear both in the Bible and in the Qur&#x2019;an through an ongoing comparison whose focus at every point will be on God as the understood central character. Our modest goal will be a certain aesthetic appropriation not of the entire Bible or the entire Qur&#x2019;an but just of these related passages within the two. My hope is that you will join me by whatever suspension of belief or disbelief works for you as I give primary consideration to Allah, God, as the overwhelmingly dominant central figure in the passages from the Qur&#x2019;an. <br><br> Over the centuries, the view most often taken of the Qur&#x2019;an by Jews and Christians alike has been the view classically taken by Jews of the New Testament&#x2014;namely, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s true is not new, and what&#x2019;s new is not true.&#x201d; Non-Muslims have disbelieved and dismissed what Muslims believe of the Qur&#x2019;an&#x2014;namely, that it is God&#x2019;s last word to mankind, the crown of revelation, restoring what Jews and Christians had lost from or suppressed in their scriptures by oblivion or corruption. My invitation here to Jews and Christians and the many others who disbelieve that bold Muslim claim is that, as a modest exercise in literary appreciation, they temporarily suspend their disbelief while together we attempt an engagement with God as the central character of the Qur&#x2019;an, and with the Qur&#x2019;an as an elusively powerful work of literature. My invitation to Muslims is that just as they might pray in a mosque on Friday but study its dome as students of architecture on a Tuesday, so they too might play along with this &#x201c;Tuesday exercise,&#x201d; this literary engagement with just a few selections from the Qur&#x2019;an, read in conjunction with matching passages from the Bible. Honoring the Holy Qur&#x2019;an in this way, as literature, is a way to open it, with sympathy, to new readers. <br> &nbsp;<br> In the first of my books on God, <i>God: A Biography,</i> I wrote about God as he instructed Israel to remember him: <br><br> <i>In times to come, when your son asks you, &#x201c;What is the meaning of the decrees and laws and customs that Yahweh our God has laid down for you?&#x201d; you shall tell your son, &#x201c;Once we were Pharaoh&#x2019;s slaves in Egypt, and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt by his mighty hand. Before our eyes Yahweh worked great and terrible signs and wonders against Egypt, against Pharaoh and all in his House. And he brought us out from there to lead us into the land he swore to our fathers he would give to us. And Yahweh commanded us to observe all these laws and to fear Yahweh our God so as to be happy for ever and to live, as he has granted us to do until now.&#x201d; (Deuteronomy 6:20-24)</i><br><br> This was the Yahweh who&#x2014;as &#x201c;the lord&#x201d; in most translations&#x2014;is the initially invincible protagonist of the Tanakh or Jewish Bible, which became, as included in the Christian Bible, the Old Testament. Yet in the Tanakh, after Yahweh&#x2019;s encounter with Job, he falls strangely silent: he never speaks again, and it seems that Israel comes to count decreasingly on His &#x201c;mighty hand.&#x201d; He is remembered with gratitude and devotion, to be sure, but his power becomes a distant future hope rather than a compelling present reality.<br><br>In my second God book, <i>Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God, </i>I wrote about God as Yahweh the Jew&#x2014;the God of the Jews returning to action as a Jew himself:<br><br> <i>In the beginning was the Word:</i><br><i> The Word was with God</i><br><i> And the Word was God. (John 1:1)</i><br><br> And then the stunning claim:<br><br> <i>The Word became flesh,</i><br><i> he lived among us,</i><br><i> and we saw his glory,</i><br><i> the glory that he has from the Father as only Son of the Father,</i><br><i> full of grace and truth. (John 1:14)</i><br><br> This claim stunning was stunning less for any arcane metaphysical reason, I argued, than for the fact that this divine Jew, confronted with Caesar as the new Pharaoh, does not, as of old, crush the brutal Roman oppressor with mighty hand and outstretched arm but instead goes meekly to His own Roman crucifixion. Yes, Jesus rises from the tomb, and his followers take his resurrection as the promise of eternal life, and yet Caesar is still Caesar, and in a few decades will destroy the Jerusalem Temple and send God&#x2019;s people into exile and mass enslavement. If this is victory, the terms have changed so radically as to signal a crisis in the life of God.<br><br>But as this book is to be about God in the Qur&#x2019;an, why am I not talking about Allah&#x2014;God in the Qur&#x2019;an&#x2014;from the first sentence? Why trouble to say even this much about God in those earlier scriptures?<br><br> I do so because I undertook this book in early 2017 in the aftermath of an American presidential election heavily impacted by continuing &#x201c;jihadi&#x201d; attacks all over the world. Throughout that electoral campaign, fear of further such attacks had been intensely on American minds. During the Republican National Convention in 2016, one prime-time speaker evoked that fear as follows:<br><br> <i>On Monday, an Afghan refugee in Germany used an ax and knives to slash and wound train passengers while shouting &#x201c;Allahu akbar.&#x201d; Last week, ISIS claimed responsibility after a Tunisian man drove a cargo truck into a crowd in Nice, France. He murdered eighty-four people including ten children, three Americans, and injured over 300 others. Two weeks ago, almost 300 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded in bombing attacks in Baghdad.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><i>Last month, a radical Islamist in Paris stalked a French police officer to his home where he murdered the officer, tortured his wife to death in front of their three-year-old son, while streaming it all on social media. He was pondering out loud whether to kill the 3-year-old when he was killed by police.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><i>Two days before that, an attacker pledging allegiance to ISIS killed forty-nine people in an Orlando nightclub, and wounded dozens more.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><i>All this in just the past thirty-seven days. We cannot let ourselves grow numb to these accumulating atrocities. One analysis estimated that since January 2015 some 30,000 people have been killed at the hands of terrorists.</i><br><br>Newt Gingrich, who spoke these words, was sadly mistaken in believing that electing Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, to the American presidency could bring such violence under peaceful control. Trump was elected, but more than a year later, on November 24, 2017, gunmen carrying the black flag of the Islamic State killed more than 300 worshippers at the Bir al-Abed Sufi mosque in Egypt. Gingrich was not inventing the atrocities that he recited, nor was he mistaken in claiming that the Muslim terrorists who perpetrate atrocities like the Bir al-Abed slaughter (it should be said that many more Muslims than non-Muslims have died at the hands of such terrorists) do invoke Islam as justification and motivation, however repugnant their doing so may be to other Muslims. An American writing about the Qur&#x2019;an, which is the foundation of Islam, could scarcely ignore the fact that all this was in the air or that there are passages in the Qur&#x2019;an that lend themselves to such terrifying use.<br><br>Before this book comes to its conclusion, we may have visited a couple of those passages, but we have some important preliminary work to do. While I would not care to defend the claim that Islam is a &#x201c;religion of peace,&#x201d; neither would I defend the same claim for Christianity or Judaism. I do not deny that true religious pacifism has existed at times and still exists in a few places, but not one of these three religions deserves that title. Moreover, to clear the air just a little, we need to consider in general terms the relationship between violence as espoused by a religious community, <i>any</i> religious community, and violence as expressed in that community&#x2019;s sacred scriptures. In particular, what sort of obligation, if any, does war, strife, or violence in Jewish and Christian scripture impose on either Jews or Christians? <br><br> Let me illustrate the complexity of that question for these two traditions by choosing two or three quotations from the scriptures of each, beginning with Christianity. Only then will we be ready to turn again to Islam. <br><br>The belief that Jesus is the Word Incarnate&#x2014;the Word who was with God and who was God before the creation of the world&#x2014;has been foundational in Christianity for centuries. This is, to be sure, the Christ of faith rather than the Jesus of history, but the faith has its history no less than Jesus does, and, historically, this belief has been central to it. In the Roman Catholicism of my boyhood, every celebration of the Mass ended with the first chapter of the Gospel of John&#x2014;the very chapter that, quoted above, identifies Jesus as the Word Incarnate. These were the words that the devout Catholic, leaving morning Mass, was to hear last and take with him out into the world.<br><br>With that in mind, let us turn to the final appearance of the Incarnate Word of God in the New Testament. This appearance comes at the end of Chapter 19 of Revelation, the last book in the New Testament, where we read:<br><br> <i>And now I saw heaven open, and a white horse appear; its rider was called Faithful and True; he is a judge with integrity, a warrior for justice. His eyes were flames of fire, and his head was crowned with many coronets; the name written on him was known only to himself, his cloak was soaked in blood. He is known by the name, The Word of God. Behind him, dressed in linen of dazzling white, rode the armies of heaven on white horses. From his mouth came a sharp sword to strike the pagans with; he is the one who will rule them with an iron scepter, and tread out the wine of Almighty God&#x2019;s fierce anger. On his cloak and on his thigh there was a name written: The King of kings and the Lord of lords.<br></i><br><i> I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he shouted aloud to all the birds that were flying high overhead in the sky, &#x201c;Come here. Gather together at the great feast that God is giving. There will be the flesh of kings for you, and the flesh of great generals and heroes, the flesh of horses and their riders and of all kinds of men, citizens and slaves, small and great.&#x201d; (19:11-18)</i><br><br>Here, near the end of the New Testament, is a picture of Christ as a warrior mounted on a white horse, His cloak drenched in blood, leading an army similarly mounted, ruling the world with an iron scepter, slaughtering His enemies, &#x201c;the pagans,&#x201d; with a miraculous sword, and summoning the vultures to feed on the flesh of their corpses. In the <i>New Jerusalem Bible</i> translation just quoted, the italicized phrases all come from the Old Testament; their multiplication is designed to make this sanguinary passage seem the final victory of Good over Evil. And there are other allusions that could have been italicized. &#x201c;The wine of Almighty God&#x2019;s fierce anger,&#x201d; for example, is an allusion to the Book of Isaiah 63:2-6, in which Yahweh answers as follows the rhetorical question &#x201c;Why are your garments red / your clothes like someone treading the winepress?&#x201d;<br><br> <i>I have trodden the winepress alone;</i><br><i> Of my people, not one was with me.</i><br><i> So I trod them down in my anger,</i><br><i> I trampled on them in my wrath.</i><br><i> Their blood squirted over my garments</i><br><i> And all my clothes are stained.</i></p><h2>Ruark Remembered: By the Man Who Knew Him Best</h2><p>Robert Ruark (1915-1965) ranks, in the minds of most discerning readers, as the finest outdoor writer ever to grace the American literary scene. His is an enduring fame, thanks primarily to three books, <i>The Old Man and the Boy</i>, <i>The Old Man s Boy Grows Older</i>, and an African classic, <i>Horn of the Hunter</i>. Of course, Ruark was also the author of several blockbuster novels, an immensely popular newspaper columnist, a satirist of considerable skill, and a tireless bon vivant. Fame and the ability to crunch out a prodigious amount of first-rate prose on his battered portable typewriter brought him considerable fortune. Now, some two generations after the Ruark s death, Sporting Classics will release a brand new book on the great author. Just recently discovered, the text was written more than forty years ago by Alan Ritchie, who faithfully served as Ruark s personal secretary and advisor for the last fourteen years of his life. The book starts out with a wonderful foreword by legendary African professional hunter Harry Selby who guided Ruark on a number of his safaris. It also features a number of photographs of Ruark that have never before appeared in any book.</p><p><strong></strong><strong>Jim Casada,</strong> the editor and compiler of this work, was a university history professor before taking early retirement to write full time on hunting, fishing, and other outdoor-related topics.

This stunningly illustrated history of the horse in art documents the creative journey from prehistoric cave paintings to the war horses of Uccello, the thoroughbred portraits of Stubbs, the enigmatic prints of Elisabeth Frink and beyond. It explores the role of the horse in Eastern imagery and as the subject of myth and legend; as a symbol of power and an ally in war; as the subject of anatomical scrutiny and the romantic embodiment of human feeling; and as the emblem of sporting pleasures and prowess. The book sheds particular light on man's relationship with the horse, and on the story of equine evolution from the stocky primitive to today's thoroughbred.</p><p>Tamsin Pickeral is an author and art historian specializing in books on art, horsemanship, animal husbandry and travel.

They are mistaken: Most diets are so unhealthy as to be useless in the long run. In fact, most diets aren't even useful in the short run, even for weight loss, because the lost weight invariably comes right back.<br><br>Occasionally, a diet will work for some lucky dieter. But for every dieter who loses weight, there are hundreds more who fail. And no one ever explains why a diet works, when it does, or why it fails.<br><br>The Body Type Diet answers these questions. Body Type Dieting is not just another peel-away-the-pounds fad. Rather, it is a systematic medical program relating different types of diet to different types of body, in order to enable each individual to find the diet that will be effective, safe, and healthy for him or her.<br><br><b>HOW I DISCOVERED THE IMPORTANCE OF BODY TYPES</b><br><br>I developed the concept of the Body Type Diet and Lifetime Nutrition Plan more than twenty years ago, when I was a young doctor with a busy general practice. Unlike medical specialists, who focus their attention on one system of the body or another, I was a generalist, accustomed to looking at my patients as whole people in whom all parts of the body have to work together for health. Naturally one of the problems often presented to me was the problem of overweight, and I was often asked for advice about diet. Since the importance of maintaining one's ideal weight is, from a health standpoint, beyond dispute, I determined to find a way to help my patients achieve this goal.<br><br>But I was not fully satisfied with any of the diets available at that time. What struck me was that while one or two patients would lose weight on one or the other of the many popular diets that exist in the marketplace, most of them either failed to lose, or lost weight and quickly gained it back.<br><br>I decided to take a closer look at those of my patients who did lose weight successfully, and to isolate those factors that were the keys to success.<br><br>Two patients who happened to come to my office on the same day, illustrated clearly what I discovered. The two were both women, good friends who had decided to diet together for mutual reinforcement. Both had managed to lose about nine pounds; one wanted to lose six more, the other sixteen more pounds. Both had been on a popular diet that was low in protein and fats and high in complex carbohydrates. But there the similarity ended.<br><br>The first patient, whom I will call Anna, was the one within six pounds of her weight goal, and she looked very well. She had lost her weight from the right places--her hips and thighs, rather than her face, which had never been fat. She told me that she felt healthy and vigorous even though she was dieting, and she looked that way, too.<br><br>The second patient, Joanne, was a contrast to Anna in almost every way. She retained "pockets" of fat on her outer thighs, which, she told me, she'd been unable to lose. Her face was gaunt and she had a pasty, unhealthy color. Moreover, she was having difficulty sticking to her diet, and was constantly suffering from an intense craving for sweets.<br><br>What was particularly interesting to me was that both women had followed exactly the same diet. I knew them both, and was confident that Joanne had not been "cheating"; she was highly motivated to lose weight. Obviously, the difference was not in the diet but in the dieter, or rather in the interaction of dieter and diet. The way the diet worked for Anna was obviously not the way it worked for Joanne.<br><br>Examining the two women, I discovered that their bodies were indeed very different. Anna had a very steady, strong metabolism. She had excellent digestion, was active all day, and had relatively little variation in her energy level. Joanne was a very different type; she was livelier than Anna, but more given to ups and downs in energy. She had intense nervous energy, but tended to "crash" in the late afternoon if she wasn't careful. She drank a lot of coffee and diet cola to keep herself going. In short, she was more high-strung and more delicate than Anna.<br><br>I decided to put Joanne on a completely different diet from the high-carbohydrate one that had seemed to work for Anna. The diet I selected was high in protein, lower in carbohydrates, and eliminated all caffeine drinks. The idea of this diet was to provide a steadying balance for her delicate, high-strung system. Meanwhile, I told Anna to continue as she had been, until she had lost the rest of her excess weight.<br><br>To my delight, Joanne responded beautifully to her changed program. After just a week on the diet she began to look healthier. Her face, which had been so gaunt, filled out and her cheeks were rosy. But more important to her, she began to lose the pockets of fat on her thighs. Within four weeks she had lost the entire sixteen pounds. Five years after that memorable month, she was still at her ideal weight.<br><br>Anna, meanwhile, continued on her high-carbohydrate diet and by the end of the next week she had lost her remaining six pounds. Now both women had dieted successfully--but on diets that, like their metabolisms, were diametrically different.<br><br>The conclusion reached from Joanne, Anna, and thousands of other patients over the years was that success in dieting depends on the particular character of the dieter's metabolism. If this vital factor is not considered, the diet will inevitably fail. Without a system for determining what type of body a dieter has, dieters and their physicians alike are at the mercy of chance and guesswork.<br><br><b>THE FOUR BODY TYPES</b><br><br>Individuals process foods differently--this much is common knowledge. We have all observed that some people can eat much more than others without gaining weight. Also, some people need more of different kinds of food--more protein, more carbohydrates, or more fats. And some people are affected adversely by foods that other people tolerate well.<br><br>These facts are indications of a vitally important truth: Each person has his or her body type, based upon how food is metabolized in the body. There are a number of traditional systems for classifying individuals according to body type. Perhaps the best known is the classification into ectomorph (the slim, rangy person), endomorph (the rounder, plumper person), or mesomorph (the thicker, more muscular person), developed by Dr. William Sheldon in his book <b>The Atlas of Man</b>. The limitation of this system is that it is purely descriptive; it doesn't tell why a person is slim, round, or muscular.<br><br>Another system is that used in classical Chinese medicine, which classifies bodies according to which of the five "elements" (earth, water, fire, air, or ether) predominates. While this system has a good deal of value and is useful in certain courses of treatment, I wanted to find one that would be both highly accurate and easier to use. The same consideration applied to the Ayurvedic or classical Indian system, in which individuals are classified into types according to their balance of <i>doshas,</i> or elements: <i>vata, pitta,</i> and <i>kapha.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Ayurveda is a highly refined and developed system of medicine, but it requires years of study to use correctly. I wanted a system that would use recognizable Western terms, be in full agreement with my scientific and medical knowledge about the body, and be readily understandable by lay person and physician alike. In short, I wanted a system that would prescribe the right diet while accurately describing the body type.<br><br>I set about to develop such a system. I began to classify individuals according to which of their four major glands--the pituitary gland, the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, and the gonads or sex glands--was most active, or dominant, in their metabolism. According to this system, I could then classify a person as a "Pituitary Type," a "Thyroid Type," an "Adrenal Type," or a "Gonadal Type."<br><br>The inspiration for my system of body types came from Henry Bieler, M.D., a great physician and nutritionist, and author of Food Is Your Best Medicine. Dr. Bieler shows in this book how it is possible to distinguish between individuals with a dominant thyroid and a dominant adrenal gland on the basis of fairly obvious physical characteristics. Dr. Bieler's "thyroid type" is slender, fine-boned, long-limbed--much like the classic ectomorph. His "adrenal type" is squarer in shape, thicker and more solid, and closely resembles the classic mesomorph. Dr. Bieler also suspected that there might be a third body type, the pituitary type, but he was not certain of this and did not fully define what this type would look like.</p><h2>Dreams of Rescue: A Novel</h2><p>&#34;I have spent the winter at my summer place,&#34; begins the narrator of this startlingly original literary chiller. Juliana Durrell Smythe, known for her &#34;female in jeopardy&#34; performances on film, fears her roles are proving prophetic. As an actress, she is accustomed to rescue. In movies, &#34;Having known the comfort of muscled arms, I still expect, without reason, to be carried to safety and, ultimately, to be loved.&#34; But confined to her Victorian lake house, Juliana discovers the discrepancies between film and actual jeopardy. &#34;The police have not turned out to be kindly, potential lovers....&#34; She must walk the fault line of fiction and confront the mysterious and violent end of her marriage. An atmosphere of danger descends with the snow. The men who enter Juliana&#39;s life seem suspect; her predicament shadowed by the distress of her housecleaner. How much did she see? How much does she know? Haunted by her past roles and the history of her romantic home, built for a wedding in 1899, Juliana&#39;s marital mystery becomes entwined with that of the original Victorian bride&#39;s. To survive, she is compelled to connect a nineteenth-century disappearance to the contemporary despair of the lakeside resort. In a snowscape of dazzling beauty, Juliana must enact the role that will save or cost her own life. Plumbing the secrets of two centuries, Cunningham has written a hypnotic novel that will transport the reader into a brilliantly evoked world. With its hard-chiseled realities and incandescent images, Dreams of Rescue is a new take on a classic form, that shatters convention and will entrance readers long after its stunning finale.</p><p><b>Laura Shaine Cunningham</b> is the author of <i>Beautiful Bodies, A Place in the Country,</i> and <i>Sleeping Arrangements.</i> A playwright and journalist, she has been published in <i>The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly,</i> and <i>The New York Times.</i> She is a native New Yorker.<p><b>From Chapter One</b> <b>In Character</b> </p><p> I have spent the winter at my summer place. Every night I watch the tabloid television shows for news of other estranged wives, and the extended coverage on those who have already been murdered. </p><p> Each evening I wrap myself in a shawl and settle on the sofa. Then I lie back and stare at the double flicker of the television and the fireplace. I am not operating at full efficiency, but am sustained as if on a dual pilot light. Some nights I play compact disc recordings, always operas, at the same time that I watch television, and the combined sound and light gives the cottage an electric liveliness, an air of camaraderie, as if I were having a party without people. </p><p> My summer place makes for an odd winter hideout. I am reminded of the scene in <i>Dr. Zhivago,</i> the movie, in which Omar Sharif finds his dacha transformed into an ice palace. Zhivago is freezing, but one senses that the unexpected beauty of his crystallized home sustains his soul. My summerhouse is much smaller than Zhivago's, but it, too, is iced with winter whimsy and offers its own chill consolation. </p><p> Can I call it pleasure? Perhaps not, under these circumstances, but my spirit rises to the white vista, the glittering twigs, and cushioned bushes. I love the snow -- have always loved it -- and now I need the snow in ways I never imagined. </p><p> The snow might save me, in every sense. The snow keeps a perfect palette: I can detect if anyone has tried to approach on foot. That is a practical advantage of being snowbound, but the spiritual benefit may prove more significant. To survive now, I must recall beauty, the possibility of bliss.... </p><p> This house was dedicated to love, to the promise of joy. The house is not an ordinary house; Casa di Rosas was built as a chapel for a single occasion, the June wedding of a tobacco heiress in 1899. The Wedding Cake House, as it is more often called, has always depended on the triumph of charm over practicality. Only its fanciful design -- and the increased market for second homes upstate -- saved the structure from demolition years ago. </p><p> The Wedding Cake House stands at the edge of a bluff, overlooking the lake. The rationale for this picturesque but precarious position was the portico, where the bride and groom could pose, framed by latticework, the blue glitter of Lake Bonticou as backdrop. </p><p> From where I lie on the sofa, I can see their original wedding photograph, sepia and further faded from the century of sunlight. The Victorian bride and groom appear formal in their garb and expectation. They are young and extraordinarily attractive, but they look to one another with the solemn intention of the past, displaying none of the abandon of my own wedding photograph. My Kodachrome print fell from its hanging nail long ago and now leans against the wall below the more formal 1899 portrait. The contrast is acute: The unposed picture shows me bare-armed as I look up at my new husband; we are laughing, I remember, because the day was chillier than anticipated, and we tried to feign composure. I am wearing a sleeveless white crepe cocktail dress and trying not to visibly shiver; the camera caught us as we collapsed in laughter. The Victorian couple's decorum and our lack of propriety strike me -- as if my husband and I, the interlopers, trespassed to carouse where the first bride and groom exchanged sacred vows. </p><p> Now, in late February, the light slices through the rooms. The halls appear as through a reducing glass, angles oversharp and outlined. Even the parquet floor seems heightened and whitened, as if the cold raised wax to its surface. The windows tremble and the furnace roars. Every several minutes the boiler grunts and fires. The house vibrates at the effort of keeping the wind outside these walls. </p><p> The Wedding Cake House was never intended to be used in winter, let alone converted to a home. Many years ago, the previous owners inserted a bed, dressing, and bathroom under the eaves, and the heat still travels toward the original vaulted ceiling and escapes through fissures in the attic. The upper story rooms overheat, while the downstairs living and dining area remain chilled. </p><p> One of the challenges of this winter has been to stay warm. My husband and I added, at some cost, this fireplace into which I now stare. The leaping flames provide a visual cue, but the fireplace loses more heat than it provides. There is a small radius of warmth directly in front of the crackling hearth, and I huddle toward that. I feel warm as long as I don't move, keep my shawl tucked around me, and sip my hot tea and listen to operas. I hope the arias will, in a magical aural equivalent to the beauty outside, counteract the ugliness of the events that happened here. </p><p> I have a mental habit, perhaps it qualifies as a tic, the reverse of tic douloureux, tic of sadness. My tic is the prediction of happiness, or at least pleasure. Before I actually see a person or a destination for the first time, I visualize appealing men and women, beguiling locations. I'm not conscious of projecting these people or places; they present themselves, full blown, in exact detail. En route to the actual meeting or on the phone, I conjure a face, a home, an office. </p><p> I'm not always accurate; I'm often disappointed, occasionally alarmed, when confronted with "the real thing." I have no idea why I project these visions, as they run counter to my experience. But I cannot stop, nor do I wish to. I have my successes -- perfect matches of expectation and reality and a few spectacular improvements over fantasy. I believe my dreams-come-true, my good fortune, predict that I will be blessed somehow. I have always entertained the idea that, someday, someone will come forward on my behalf and offer me love, in all its most magnanimous incarnations, and I will be forever changed, blessed. It's almost happened, just that way. </p><p> Seventeen years ago, en route here for my surprise honeymoon, I "saw" Casa di Rosas in my mind's eye. I pictured a pleasant cottage, nothing fanciful. My projection was specific as usual: I saw a blanched cabin, listing blue shutters, picket fence. A single rosebush, thorny. Hummingbirds. The entire vision was blanched, as in an overexposed print. </p><p> We arrived in June. The orchard was in bloom, an aisle of cherry and apple blossoms. The white-veiled trees were bridal for us, as they had been for the original newlywed couple. We, too, walked that blossomed aisle, kissed beneath the boughs of the most bountiful tree, the weeping cherry. Matt and I admired the roses for which the house was named -- "antique" roses -- white, scarlet, teatime yellow. It was not that there were so many roses; it was their run of the property that charmed me. Roses climbed trellises; they poked up from behind the rusting wrought-iron gate and rambled in hedges round the house. The white roses twined and twisted through the wedding latticework on the portico, then descended the cliff, adhering to the rock ledges all the way down to the lake. These renegade white roses had escaped, domestic joining the wild, and they flourished in aromatic profusion. </p><p> I inhaled, sighed. We came to honeymoon, and remained to purchase. It was I who cried, "Oh, this is the place." The house was so inexpensive, it seemed to be a gift, sold "below market" with all "the original furnishings," including the four-poster bed upstairs and the rather sunken sofa, upon which I now recline. Even the rugs remained, faded Orientals, showing bare at the tread of my predecessors. The style, Victorian, with many griffin-clawed, ball-holding furniture feet, was not especially fine, just old. But the bureaus were filled with creamy linens monogrammed AJD, almost my maiden initials. Folded sheets, lace-trimmed shams and cases, embroidered holders for every household object -- <i>Spoons, Buttonhooks.</i> I was beyond charmed; I felt enchanted. </p><p> The house met my criteria at that time -- a perfect set, I thought, for romance. I could walk outside naked by moonlight and not be spotted by neighbors. The night we took possession, my husband and I dove naked from our dock into the lake. We laughed as he carried me, nude, over the threshold. Propriety was not a problem then... </p><p> Now seclusion has become ironic. My desire for privacy boomeranged; no one witnessed what happened to me here. Yet, even after all that occurred, I still find solace in this place during its winter metamorphosis. The orchard bears blossoms of snow. The lake has become a Lalique; the house itself a confection. True to its conception, Casa di Rosas looks like the bakery's best wedding cake, kept fresh under refrigeration. Icicles double its Victorian frills; frost fern retrace the curtain lace. </p><p> Outdoors, the grounds are decorous as a deco lounge, draped in white, dust-covered to stay fresh for the next season. The summer wicker furniture, casualties of my distraction, remains unstored for winter, arranged in conversational circles on the white lawn. The porch swing sways, carrying its plumped white pillows, a wind-sculpted passenger. And over all is the whisper of the snow, the unending snow. </p><p> Never before has there been so much snow. The locals, the Bonticouans, as the summer people call the natives of Lake Bonticou, swear that this winter surpassed all records. The snow fell before the leaves, aborting autumn. More snow has fallen than the town plows can push; the roads have narrowed to lunar canyons. </p><p> I must be the single person here not to complain about the snow; it serves my purpose. The snow has become my buffer zone, kept my situation on literal ice. The blizzard seems to have drifted selectively: The roads may be impassable, but the wind whisked a magical passageway from my front door to the woodpile, a route along which I scurry several times a day to feed my now continuous fire. I have lost only my driveway; the snow drifted over it, obscuring even the delineation of the road that used to lead to me. </p><p> I have had an order of protection since New Year's Eve. The actual order, a smudged Xerox, I keep in an old Bendel box, labeled THE ATTACK. In my mind the order is strung round my property like a red surveyor's ribbon, looped through the gray trees, to define my new boundaries. My husband may not step within a thousand feet of me. If he does, I can summon the sheriff of Lake Bonticou. I imagine the sheriff striding from the woods, with his own order of blue knights, the state troopers. </p><p> I should know better than to entertain such visions. I already know the reality: I have dialed 911; I have summoned the police. The squad car, red light pulsing, has skidded up this driveway. I know what actually happened next... </p><p> Yet, even after this experience, I am too attuned to fiction to contemplate danger without rescue. I'm infected with optimism. I have seen too many melodramas in which the heroine is saved "in the nick of time." I am conditioned now to expect cinematic salvation. I confess that I am implicated in these fictions, having performed in those movies known in the trade as "FemJep" -- female in jeopardy. For sixteen years, in a dozen films, I have played the victim-heroine. The aftereffects have been insidious: Having known the comfort of male, muscled arms, I still expect, against reason, to be carried to safety and, ultimately, to be loved. </p><p> Now it worries me that I was so often cast as a victim. What is it about me that I must play the hunted, the frightened? I once asked my friend the casting director, Elsbieta, and she said, "It's your eyes: They widen so nicely in terror. And the pointy chin...You look sympathetic yet vulnerable." She used a word I loathe -- <i>plucky.</i> I put <i>plucky</i> right there beside spunky, which is my usual character description in scripts -- "spunky but vulnerable." And I am light for my height: I can be carried or thrown without too much stress on the actors playing either my attackers or my saviors. </p><p> Of course, I imagined a different career. In fifth grade, we were asked to select a play and dramatize a scene for class. Other girls brought in <i>Peter Pan</i> or <i>Grease.</i> I enacted the climax of Tennessee Williams's <i>Suddenly, Last Summer. </i>I can laugh now at how I flattened myself against the blackboard and recited, in breathy tones, the murder of my beloved bisexual Sebastian: "Against the white wall," I recall saying. "Blood against the white wall." I modeled my performance on Elizabeth Taylor's in the film, American Classics Channel version. The teacher's eyes widened and her jaw dropped, but I was recommended to the drama club, and in a sense never left. Soon after I went out to audition for ingenue roles, I was cast -- my first strangulation by a serial killer who preyed on schoolgirls. I recall being bent backward in a school coatroom. My legs kicking. I wore small white boots. </p><p> Once cast, my trajectory has been direct -- straight to Wardrobe for the costumes that would ultimately rip, to Makeup for cosmetics that would smear, and to Special Effects for the fake blood packets, to be concealed and burst upon puncture. I have, most often, been stabbed. Thirteen stabbings, three strangulations, two drownings, one gunshot to the head, and, most inventively, a single impaling with a decorative sword. I survived all. In that sword sequence I had to do ten takes; I was "speared" for days. I cannot even count the hours I have worked on hospital sets, tucked into beds with artful bandages on my head. </p><p> Last year I began to refuse scripts in which I was threatened. Now I wonder: How much was premonition? Was it possible that deep within, in some untapped subconscious from whence all motivation springs, I had begun to question whether I wanted to play victim-heroines anymore? Had I sensed in that core of the self, where all is known, the reason? </p><p> I should have paid closer attention to the tabloid news, on which most heroines appear in the past tense. FemJep as genre is, I am discovering, criminally false. The producers themselves should be stalked and shot. I had always supposed that such films were not realistic, but the gap between truth and fiction is wider than I would have guessed, and I have taken an almost fatal fall into the abyss. </p><p> The first night under the new order, I flipped the yellow pages to <i>Security</i> and telephoned around the county, trying to hire a bodyguard, only to discover that I could not afford one. Even the decrepit, crackle-voiced self-described "seventy-five-year-old retired cop" said, "Have to charge you fifty dollars an hour. And how many hours do you need?" </p><p> I have no answer. My case could go on for years; it may never be resolved to my satisfaction. In my economic situation -- my bank account emptied, unable to work -- I could not be protected for a week. My assets, like my house and grounds, are frozen. </p><p> In movies, security cost is no object. In my female jeopardy roles I was accustomed to quality alarm systems and even the occasional high-tech electronically sealed half-million-dollar so-called panic room. In my actual low-budget, low-tech life, the cost of being fully "armed against intruders" is prohibitive. I must settle for sound waves that cover my "main points of entry," the downstairs front and ...</p></p><h2>Discovering Our Past: A History of the United States, Modern Times, Teacher Edition (THE AMERICAN JOURNEY (SURVEY))</h2><p>The print Teacher Wraparound Edition is built on the principles of Understanding by Design.

Then the drums rolled, signaling that instead he was to be exiled to the living death of Siberia. <br>Siberia was so cold the mercury froze in the thermometer. In prison, Dostoevsky was surrounded by murderers, thieves, parricides, and brigands who drank heavily, quarreled incessantly, and fought with horrible brutality.

But as Alvin Felzenberg points out, there are many flaws with these rating systems. Despite reams of new historical information, the rankings never seem to change very much. They all favor a certain kind of president-those who tended to increase executive power. That aside, the idea of rating presidential performance on a simple linear scale is absurd. <i>The Leaders We Deserved (and a Few We Didn't)</i> breaks presidential performance into easily understandable categories-character, vision, competence, foreign policy, economic policy, human rights, and legacy-and assesses, for each category, the best and worst. The result is a surprisingly fresh look at how the various presidents stack up against each other, with some of the greats&#x201d; coming off far worse than their supposedly mediocre colleagues.</p><p><b>Alvin S.

The book focuses on the careers of four operatives: Frank Wisner, Richard Bissell, Tracy Barnes, and Desmond FitzGerald, all of whom helped guide the covert actions and growth of the CIA. Bissell was best known owing to his involvement in the Bay of Pigs fiasco, but Wisner, as the early director of covert operations, was the key figure in the agency's early history. All four appear to have been more interested in the big operation, which could go spectacularly wrong, than in the slow process of intelligence gathering. Much of this same material is covered in Burton Hersh's more critical The Old Boys: The American Elite and the Origins of the CIA (LJ 2/15/92). The author, a managing editor at Newsweek, also co-wrote The Wise Men (LJ 10/15/86), which was similar in approach. Recommended for espionage collections of public and academic libraries.?Daniel K.

We drove north on I-5, and I felt divided in half, like this highway I was on&#x2014;one side going north, the other going south. Half of me wanted to turn back, to stay in Los Angeles and fight for my family&#x2014;my father, my mother, my sisters and brothers&#x2014;stay by their side even though our relationship was in ruins. The city fell farther and farther behind me, the smog blanketing the buildings as if Los Angeles were already wrapped in the haze of memory.<br> <br>The other half of me faced north with excitement, optimistic despite my fears. I was transferring to the University of California, Santa Cruz, leaving to pursue the wild dream of becoming the first in my family to earn a university degree. The key to the American Dream will soon be mine, I told myself. This was no small feat for a former undocumented immigrant from Mexico. I felt proud to have made it this far.<br> <br>Then I remembered my father&#x2019;s betrayal, and my optimism disappeared. Though I left of my own accord, I suddenly felt as if I had been exiled from Los Angeles. No longer wanted or needed.<br> <br>My boyfriend looked at me and said the words I was desperate to hear, &#x201c;Your father is very proud of you. He told me so.&#x201d; I was grateful that he was doing the driving. If I had been at the wheel, I would have turned back.<br> <br>Edwin had been accepted at California State University, Monterey Bay, which was about an hour south of Santa Cruz. I had met him at Pasadena City College earlier in the year, right before my father and stepmother decided to end their marriage. Throughout the past months, I had been by my father&#x2019;s side supporting him through the chaotic separation in any way I could. I even considered staying in L.A. to help him get his life back in order once the divorce was final.<br> <br>My father, a maintenance worker with a third-grade education, spoke little English. Eleven years earlier, when I was nine years old, he had returned to Mexico to bring my older siblings and me back with him to the United States to give us a better life. My older sister, brother, and I took our father&#x2019;s divorce as an opportunity to show him that his sacrifice had paid off. We spoke the language of this country. We had an American education. We could handle ourselves with the police and in court. We knew how to look out for him so he wouldn&#x2019;t end up with nothing.<br> <br>Then, my father asked my stepmother to reconsider their divorce, and she did, but with one condition&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t want us around. So, after months of standing by him and giving him our support, my father banned Mago, Carlos, and me from his life. I had packed up my bags and left his house, and the next day, my stepmother moved back in and gave my bedroom to her son and daughter-in-law. I went to stay with my PCC professor Diana Savas, for the second time since I had met her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Try to understand him,&#x201d; Edwin said. &#x201c;He knew you were leaving at the end of the summer. He didn&#x2019;t want to be alone once you left.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I could have stayed with him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For how long? One day you&#x2019;ll move out and get married. Have your own family. You wouldn&#x2019;t stay with him forever. He knew that. Besides, he didn&#x2019;t want to hold you back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He could have stood up for us the way we stood up for him,&#x201d; I said a few minutes later. &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t have to be a choice between his wife or his children. Why can&#x2019;t there be room for us in his life, too? Now he&#x2019;s just like my mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>When I was seven years old, my father left my mother for my stepmother, and she was never the same. She didn&#x2019;t want to be a mother to us anymore. It was as if when my father divorced her, she in turn divorced her children. She left us again and again in her search for another man to love her. When my father took us to live with him, we only saw her if we made the effort to visit her where she lived with her common-law husband. It hadn&#x2019;t mattered to her if we weren&#x2019;t in her life. My departure to Santa Cruz hadn&#x2019;t made a bit of difference to her. &#x201c;Ah� nos vemos,&#x201d; she had said when I called her the day before. &#x201c;See you later&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;I love you, take care, call me if you need anything&#x201d;&#x2014;the words I had hoped to hear from her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Parents disappoint us because we set expectations they can never live up to,&#x201d; Edwin said. He had the uncanny ability to know what I was thinking. He squeezed my hand and added, &#x201c;Reyna, some parents are incapable of love and affection. Don&#x2019;t you think it might be time to lower your expectations?&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked out the window and didn&#x2019;t reply. My biggest virtue and my biggest flaw was the tenacity with which I clung to my dreams, no matter how futile they might seem to others. The dream of having a true relationship with my parents was the one I had clung to the most because it was the first dream I&#x2019;d had, and the farthest from my reach.<br> <br>As we finally left the city behind us, my body stretched tight like a rubber band, and I felt a hot, searing pain in my heart until finally something inside me snapped. I was released from the bond to the place where I had come of age, the city that had witnessed my desolation and defeats, my joys and victories. Just like my hometown in Mexico, Los Angeles was now a part of my past.<br> <br><br> <br> <br>Welcome to campus!<br><br>That day in September of 1996, we drove into the main entrance of the campus and were greeted by five words carved into a block of wood that was over twenty feet long: UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ. I jumped out of the car to walk around the entrance sign, trace the huge yellow letters with my fingers, smell the wood into which they were carved, and after each letter had imprinted itself within me, I said to myself the words that needed to be said: &#x201c;I have arrived.&#x201d;<br> <br>Higher education is the only way to succeed in this country. My father had drilled that into us the minute we had arrived in Los Angeles after our third attempt at crossing the border. He had been a tyrant about school, and had even threatened to send us back to Mexico if we didn&#x2019;t come home with perfect attendance and straight A&#x2019;s. He believed so strongly in the dream of higher education that he had been completely devastated when Mago and Carlos dropped out of college. Though I had vowed not to do the same, he no longer believed in the dream and had given up on me before I even got my chance. I was determined to prove to him that he had been wrong about me.<br> <br>We drove deeper into the campus, past fields and meadows, the ocean in the distance, and when we came upon the redwoods, I said a silent thank-you to my professor Diana for insisting that I choose UCSC over UCLA, where I had also been accepted. She said that at UCLA I would be one of tens of thousands, whereas UCSC, with fewer than nine thousand students, was much smaller and better for students who were into the arts. She also believed getting out of my comfort zone would help me grow and mature.<br> <br>I had never seen trees so majestic, with bark the color of cinnamon and foliage a deep, lush green. The sky wasn&#x2019;t the pale, washed-out blue of the L.A. sky, but the vibrant, pure blue of a Van Gogh oil painting. I poked my head out the window and took deep gulps of the fresh air that smelled of earth, trees, and ocean, and something else I couldn&#x2019;t name. I became light-headed from the scents, sounds, and colors of my new home.<br> <br>&#x201c;You made the right choice.&#x201d; Edwin said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You and Diana talked me into it,&#x201d; I said, remembering the long conversations with the two of them about which university I should pick. &#x201c;But I guess I knew I was meant to be here.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t tell them that the name of the university held a special meaning for me. Santa Cruz, &#x201c;the holy cross.&#x201d; My father&#x2019;s full name was Natalio Grande Cruz. His last name literally meant &#x201c;the big cross,&#x201d; a heavy burden for me that at times was too much to bear.<br> <br>UCSC was divided into small colleges, and since I was majoring in creative writing, I chose to live at Kresge College, where the creative writing program and the Literature Department were located. As a transfer student, I could live in the apartments at Kresge East, which were reserved for juniors, seniors, and graduate students, instead of the dorms in Kresge Proper, where the freshmen and sophomores were housed. I would be sharing a four-bedroom apartment with three other students.<br> <br>After I checked in, we pulled up at the parking lot of Kresge East. As I got out of the car, I remembered sitting around the kitchen table with Carlos and Mago, listening to our father talk about the future. &#x201c;Just because we are ilegales doesn&#x2019;t mean we cannot dream,&#x201d; he said to us. Thanks to my stepmother&#x2019;s help and my father&#x2019;s determination to legalize our status, our green cards finally arrived in the mail when I was almost fifteen. That day, he had proudly handed each of us those precious cards that, even though they had the words &#x201c;RESIDENT ALIEN&#x201d; imprinted on them in accusing blue letters, gave us permission to finally step out of the shadows, to grow and thrive in the light. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done my part. The rest is up to you,&#x201d; my father had said.<br> <br>Here in the parking lot, in the middle of the frenzy of move-in day, at the sight of my peers who had arrived with their parents, grandparents, and siblings, I wished my father were at my side. Though in the end he had lost faith that I would get here, he had set the stage for my arrival. My peers had brought their families to celebrate the beginning of their journey as university students. I thought of the Mexican saying Sin padre ni madre, ni perro que me ladre. Without a father, without a mother, without a dog to bark at me.<br> <br>I turned away from the families and grabbed my suitcase and backpack from the trunk. Focus on what you&#x2019;re here to do. If I did things right, I would one day break the cycle my family had been stuck in for generations&#x2014;a cycle of poverty, hunger, and lack of education. This was the reason why I was here, and that was all that mattered.<br> <br>Edwin helped me carry my belongings to my apartment&#x2014;my clothes, some books, and my first computer, purchased on credit from Sears and still in the box.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you going to be okay?&#x201d; he asked as I walked him back to his car.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said, doing my best to not let him see how frightened I was. Edwin was handling this new stage of his life much better than I was handling mine. He had left home after high school to join the army and had fought in the Gulf War, witnessing unimaginable horrors. As an army vet, he was independent and knew how to take care of himself. I envied him for that, and as I watched him drive away in his Oldsmobile, heading back to Monterey, I wished he would stay to protect me. Instead, I was now completely alone and about to fight my battles on my own.<br> <br>I set out to explore the campus. It was late afternoon, and I didn&#x2019;t have much time before the sun went down. I had heard there was real darkness here, and as a city girl, the thought of the dark frightened me. But as I began to walk, I realized that the darkness was the least of my worries. What I was most afraid of was not knowing how to be a university student, that my community college education hadn&#x2019;t prepared me for the work ahead. I was afraid of not being able to let go of my longing for my family, afraid that the distance that separated us would damage our relationship even more than it already had. I was afraid of having come this far only to fail and have to return to Los Angeles with nothing to show for my college education&#x2014;no diploma, no job, nothing but a mountain of debt and unfulfilled dreams.<br> <br>I was afraid of not being able to make this new place feel like a real home, a place where I belonged.<br> <br>The university was nestled in the redwoods at the foot of the Santa Cruz Mountains. I found myself immersed in a grove of the world&#x2019;s tallest trees. As I walked across the footbridge that connected Kresge East and Kresge Proper, high aboveground, with a ravine below me and redwood trees all around me, I let out a long, deep sigh, and the tension inside my body eased.<br> <br>The wind rustled the trees and caressed my hair. A family of deer foraged for food in the ravine. I couldn&#x2019;t believe there were deer here. I felt as if I had entered a fairy tale. I came to a meadow by Porter College where I could see the ocean shining blue and streaked with orange as the sun set. I was nine years old when I had first seen the ocean, two months after I arrived in Los Angeles to live with my father. I had been scared to go in because I didn&#x2019;t know how to swim, so I had held tight to my father&#x2019;s hand, wanting to feel safe and protected. He had promised he wouldn&#x2019;t let go of me. We stood side by side in the water and, at least that day, he had kept his promise.<br> <br>As I looked at the ocean in the distance, I told myself there was no need to be afraid. I had come this far, despite everything. My family fell apart when we immigrated. We sacrificed so much for a shot at the American Dream, and I would be damned if I didn&#x2019;t make the dream mine. A broken family was the price for me to be here. Back in Mexico the distance between my parents and me had been two thousand miles. In Santa Cruz, the distance was three hundred, but emotionally, we were light-years apart, and this time, I was the one who had migrated north in search of a better life, leaving them all behind.<br> <br> <br>Reyna at the Porter Meadow, UCSC</p><h2>Unplanned: The Dramatic True Story of a Former Planned Parenthood Leader&#39;s Eye-Opening Journey across the Life Line</h2><p><b>Retailers Choice Award winner, 2012</b><br>Abby Johnson quit her job in October 2009.

This is a warmly intimate yet intellectually provocative personal document of originality and considerable charm.&#x201d;</b><br> &#x2014;<b>Joyce Carol Oates</b><br><br> With the birth of her first child, soon-to-be professor Laura Jean Baker finds herself electrified by oxytocin, the &#x201c;love hormone&#x201d;&#x2014;the first effective antidote to her lifelong depression. Over the next eight years, her &#x201c;oxy&#x201d; cravings, and her family, only grow&#x2014;to the dismay of her husband, Ryan, a freelance public defender. As her reckless baby&#x2013;making threatens her family&#x2019;s middle&#x2013;class existence, Baker identifies more and more with Ryan&#x2019;s legal clients, often drug&#x2013;addled fellow citizens of Oshkosh, Wisconsin. <i>Is she any less desperate for her next fix?</i><br><br> Baker is in an impossible bind: The same drive that sustains her endangers her family; <i>the cure is also the disease</i>. She explores this all&#x2013;too&#x2013;human paradox by threading her story through those of her local counterparts who&#x2019;ve run afoul of the law&#x2014;like Rob McNally, the lovable junkie who keeps resurfacing in Ryan&#x2019;s life. As Baker vividly reports on their alleged crimes&#x2014;theft, kidnapping, opioid abuse, and even murder&#x2014;she unerringly conjures tenderness for the accused, yet increasingly questions her own innocence.<br><br> Baker&#x2019;s ruthless self&#x2013;interrogation makes this her personal <i>affidavit</i>&#x2014;her sworn statement, made for public record if not a court of law. With a wrenching ending that compels us to ask whether Baker has fallen from maternal grace, this is an extraordinary addition to the literature of motherhood.</p><p><b>Laura Jean Baker</b> teaches at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, specializing in memoir, women&#x2019;s stories, crime narratives, and literature for children.

TWO HOMES is her first book for Candlewick Press. She wrote the story after talking to a child who was sad about her parents&#x2019; recent divorce. She says, "To comfort her, I talked about her two homes, and all the many things <br>she could do in them. It was a positive way of helping her accept the changes in her life, focusing not on what was missed, but on the abundance of good times &#x2014; and love &#x2014; that she would continue to share with her mom and dad."<br>Kady MacDonald Denton is the illustrator of A CHILD'S TREASURY OF NURSERY RHYMES and two books by Margaret Park Bridges - IF I WERE YOUR FATHER and IF I WERE YOUR MOTHER. TWO HOMES is her first book for Candlewick Press. She says, "Alex talks about simple things like toothbrushes, bedrooms, and friends &#x2014; and they are all special because they are part of the love Alex feels in both homes. I tried to show that love in the illustrations."*Starred Review* Ages 2-5. Young Alex introduces himself and his parents, then announces that he has two homes: sometimes he lives with Daddy (in a suburban house) and sometimes with Mommy (in a city apartment). The discussion of his two homes sets up the book's comfortable dual structure: "I have <i>two</i> rooms. My room at Daddy's. My room at Mommy's . . . I have <i>two</i> bathrooms. I have a toothbrush at Daddy's. I have a toothbrush at Mommy's." Each spread includes complementary pictures that show the boy engaged in similar activities at both locales. The ending affirms that his parents love Alex, no matter where he is and no matter where they are. Within the ink, watercolor, and gouache illustrations are delightful reproductions of Alex's own paintings. Other scenes, warm with luminous washes against white backgrounds, celebrate the everyday details of Alex's life. Parents looking for a book about separation or divorce will find few offerings as positive, matter-of-fact, or child-centered as this one. With a sure sense of audience, Masurel concentrates on the physical and emotional fundamentals that matter to children while deftly sidestepping the adult-oriented swamp of explanation and supposition. Enhanced by Denton's sensitively drawn portrayals of the characters within well-imagined scenes of domestic life, this picture book will validate the experience of other two-household children while intriguing those in single-home families. Simple, yet profoundly satisfying. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But only The Secret pulls all of the five essential concepts together into a coherent plan for achieving leadership success.The core idea, based on the authors&#39; years of experience and drawn from examples of the best leaders, is that leadership comes from service. The five ways in which leaders can succeed through service are seeing and shaping the future; engaging and developing others; reinventing continuously; valuing results and relationships; and embodying the values. Each strategy is explained in detail, with exercises and tips for integrating them into the leadership matrix.The Secret is not dry dogma; the authors show their ideas at work by following the example of a struggling leader who enrolls in a mentoring program at her company. It traces her progress in understanding and applying these concepts, and her subsequent transformation into a respected and effective leader.</p><p>In The Secret, Debbie, a struggling leader finds herself about to lose her job due to poor performance. In a desperate attempt to save her career, she enrolls in a new mentoring program offered by her company. Much to her surprise, Debbie finds her mentor is the president of the company (Jeff Brown). <p>Debbie decides that all she needs is the answer to one question, "What is the secret of great leaders?" She is convinced that if Jeff will tell her, she can apply the secret in her leadership. </p><p>Over the next 18 months Jeff explains to Debbie that the secret is rooted in an attitude. He tells her that she must be willing to become a serving leader rather than a self-serving leader. The secret is that all great leaders serve. </p><p>After Debbie learns the secret she still doesn&#x2019;t know what to do next. Jeff explains that great leaders serve in at least five ways. They... </p><p>� See and shape the future<br> � Engage and develop others<br> � Reinvent continuously<br> � Value results and relationships<br> � Embody the values </p><p>The story unfolds as Debbie learns and applies each of these imperatives with her team. As a result, Debbie&#x2019;s team goes from worst to first. They become the highest performing team within the company. </p><p>In the end, Debbie understood that all the changes and improvements were the result of the choices she made as a leader. She realized that to SERVE is a choice.

Here, too, is the first modern holy war between Islam and a resurgent Christian empire. And here is the richest cast of characters to walk upon the world stage: Washington and Jefferson, Louis XVI and Robespierre, Catherine the Great, Adams, Napoleon, and Selim III.

Of the twenty-six British climbers who, on three expeditions (1921-24), walked 400 miles off the map to find and assault the highest mountain on Earth, twenty had seen the worst of the fighting. Six had been severely wounded, two others nearly killed by disease at the Front, one hospitalized twice with shell shock. Three as army surgeons dealt for the duration with the agonies of the dying. Two lost brothers, killed in action. All had endured the slaughter, the coughing of the guns, the bones and barbed wire, the white faces of the dead. In a monumental work of history and adventure, ten years in the writing, Wade Davis asks not whether George Mallory was the first to reach the summit of Everest, but rather why he kept on climbing on that fateful day. His answer lies in a single phrase uttered by one of the survivors as they retreated from the mountain: &#39;The price of life is death&#39;. Mallory walked on because for him, as for all of his generation, death was but &#39;a frail barrier that men crossed, smiling and gallant, every day&#39;. As climbers they accepted a degree of risk unimaginable before the war. They were not cavalier, but death was no stranger. They had seen so much that it had no hold on them. What mattered was how one lived, the moments of being alive. For all of them Everest had become an exalted radiance, a sentinel in the sky, a symbol of hope in a world gone mad.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011</strong>: It&#x2019;s tempting to call Wade Davis&#x2019;s magnificent <em>Into the Silence</em> an Everest of a book. But that would be misleading. It is more like K2: challenging, technically complex, and hugely rewarding upon completion. The book starts off not with mountaineering, but with vivid, novelistic descriptions of the horrors of the First World War. Years of waste and destruction in the trenches, Davis argues, &#x201c;led a desperate nation to embrace the assault on Everest as a gesture of imperial redemption.&#x201d; Those who endured attempts on the summit all bore the scars of the Great War&#x2014;and they were drawn to the mountain by an almost contradictory desire for conquest and spiritual ablution. At the center of it all is Mallory, whose eventual disappearance effectively closed that chapter in mountaineering. His utterance &#x201c;because it&#x2019;s there&#x201d; became a new war cry, but he climbed for deeper reasons entirely. <em>-- Chris Schluep</em>An Explorer-in-Residence at the National Geographic Society, Wade Davis holds degrees in anthropology and biology and received his Ph.D. in ethnobotany, all from Harvard University.

He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>A trio of outstanding narrators brings out the best in one of James Patterson&#39;s less successful efforts. A serial killer is abducting children. Each time, he asks the child a series of questions--a wrong answer leads to the child&#39;s murder. It&#39;s no secret that the murderer is a disillusioned lawyer who thinks he can save the world by killing the children of the rich and powerful. Does this even sound believable? Detective Mike Bennett, who has adopted 10 children, is especially sensitive to the case. Bobby Cannavale gives him a deep, sandpapery voice that adds credibility to the search for the missing children. Bennett is aided by Special Agent Emily Parker, who is professionally portrayed by Orlagh Cassidy. John Glover handles a multiplicity of characters--all well done. The only negative is the story itself, especially its weak ending.

Sharp convincingly demonstrates how the five Ellicott brothers created America&#x2019;s first factory town, not in New England, but in Maryland&#x2019;s Patapsco River Valley, and modeled it according to the Quaker concept of community. As the first merchant mills prospered in grain, other entrepreneurial spirits added cotton mills and ironworks. By the Civil War, the valley was a booming industrial center, but what the powerful and unpredictable river had given it swiftly destroyed in two terrifying floods. Perceptive and elegantly written, this book challenges long-held beliefs about the origins of the Industrial Revolution in the United States, and brings to life once more a time and place almost lost to history.</p><p></p><h2>Ernst Cassirer: The Swedish Years</h2><p>Ernst Cassirer was professor in G�teborg from 1935 to 1941. This episode of his life is little known, even though the Swedish years were very important. During that time of political turmoil he wrote several books and most of the papers that are now being published posthumously.<br> This book &#x2013; based on recently discovered sources &#x2013; gives a detailed picture of Cassirer&#x2019;s life and work in Sweden. It explains how he was invited to Sweden and why he became a Swedish citizen. The analyses show how Cassirer&#x2019;s exchange with Swedish philosophers influenced his work and shed new light on his development during exile.<br> This study also contains an introduction by John Michael Krois, a chronology of the Swedish years and a description of the long lost manuscript of <i>Das Erkenntnisproblem,</i> volume four.</p><p>The Authors: Jonas Hansson, born in 1967, is Lecturer in the History of Science and Ideas at the universities of Lund and Halmstad.<br> Svante Nordin, born in 1946, is Professor of the History of Science and Ideas at the University of Lund.</p><h2>And I Alone Survived</h2><p>An account of the author&#39;s ordeal and endurance as the only survivor of a small-plane crash in the High Sierra and of her descent to safety</p><p></p><h2>Vertical Church: What Every Heart Longs for.

At the age of twenty-six he moved to Washington, D.C., and it was there he began to write.

Well, we've got something even better: Memoria Press' new <i>Classical Composition</i> program, written by James Selby, doesn't just incorporate the classical approach, it is the classical approach. Going back to the method of writing instruction used for over 2,000 years, <i>Classical Composition</i> teaches the student 14 composition skills, called the progymnasmata, a set of elementary rhetorical exercises that formed the basis of persuasive writing. This approach was used to teach writing by Quintilian and Cicero, and produced writers such as Milton, Shakespeare, and Benjamin Franklin. <br>In the Narrative Stage, students hone their ability to imitate good writing and to form their own descriptive images and new arrangements as they did in the Fable Stage. This stage also adds the skill of understanding a story&#x2019;s components, which focuses on the principle of invention, passed down to us from the ancients.</p><p></p><h2>The Letters of Vincent Van Gogh</h2><p>A classic text for art students everywhere, an edited selection of VVG&#39;s letters. * That Vincent van Gogh was one of the greatest painters in the history of European art is now generally accepted. That he was a man of high intelligence and tender affections these letters abundantly establish. By their directness and humility they bring us an intimate understanding of genius. To anyone interested in painting or in the mind of a creative artist they are indispensable. * But what makes them of supreme importance is their fascination for people who have, in the ordinary way, no particular interest in the arts. It is the human spirit, not the fame of the artist, that is the secret of their perennial attraction. * This selection by Professor Mark Roskill, who contributes an introduction and notes, also includes the memoir of van Gogh written by his sister-in-law.</p><p>This thorough collection of van Gogh&#39;s letters has been assembled with an artful eye and sensitivity to the artist&#39;s thinking. The result is an atypical take on Vincent van Gogh that avoids putting too much stress on his troubled mental state and too much straining by the editor to shape a narrative out of van Gogh&#39;s epistolary clues. Instead, we see the thoughtful and contemplative side of this creative genius, as well as his concern for the impact his art and life had on those people closest to him.<b>Vincent Willem van Gogh</b> (1853-1890) was born in Holland. He became an assistant with an international firm of art-dealers and in 1881 he went to Brussels to study art. After an unsuccessful love affair with his cousin he returned to Holland and in 1885 he painted his first masterpiece, The Potato Eaters, a haunting scene of domestic poverty. A year later his brother Theo, an art dealer, enabled him to study in Paris, where he met Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Seurat, who became very important influences on his work.<br><br>In 1888 he left Paris for the Proven�al landscape at Arles, the subject of many of his best works, including "Sunflowers" and "The Chair and the Pipe." It was here Van Gogh cut off his ear, in remorse for threatening Gauguin with a razor during a quarrel, and he was placed in an asylum for a year. On July 7, 1890 Van Gogh shot himself at the scene of his last painting, the foreboding "Cornfields with Flight of Birds," and he died two days later.<br><br><b>Ronald de Leeuw</b> has been the director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam since 1986.

Boggis is an enormously fat chicken farmer who only eats boiled chickens smothered in fat. Bunce is a duck-and-goose farmer whose dinner gives him a beastly temper. Bean is a turkey-and-apple farmer who only drinks gallons of strong cider. Mr Fox is so clever that every evening he creeps down into the valley and helps himself to food from the farms. Now the farmers have hatched a plan to BANG-BANG-BANG shoot Mr Fox dead. But, just when they think Mr Fox can&#39;t possibly escape, he makes a fantastic plan of his own . . . Listen to FANTASTIC MR FOX and other Roald Dahl audiobooks read by some very famous voices, including Kate Winslet, David Walliams and Steven Fry - plus there are added squelchy sound-effects from Pinewood Studios! Look out for new Roald Dahl apps in the App store and Google Play- including the disgusting TWIT OR MISS! and HOUSE OF TWITS inspired by the revolting Twits.</p><p>In the tradition of <i>The Adventures of Peter Rabbit</i>, this is a "garden tale" of farmer versus vermin, or vice versa. The farmers in this case are a vaguely criminal team of three stooges: "Boggis and Bunce and Bean / One fat, one short, one lean. / These horrible crooks / So different in looks / Were nonetheless equally mean." Whatever their prowess as poultry farmers, within these pages their sole objective is the extermination of our hero--the noble, the clever, the Fantastic Mr. Fox. Our loyalties are defined from the start; after all, how could you cheer for a man named Bunce who eats his doughnuts stuffed with mashed goose livers? As one might expect, the farmers in this story come out smelling like ... well, what farmers occasionally do smell like.<p> This early Roald Dahl adventure is great for reading aloud to three- to seven-year-olds, who will be delighted to hear that Mr. Fox keeps his family one step ahead of the obsessed farmers. When they try to dig him out, he digs faster; when they lay siege to his den, he tunnels to where the farmers least expect him--their own larders! In the end, Mr. Fox not only survives, but also helps the whole community of burrowing creatures live happily ever after. With his usual flourish, Dahl evokes a magical animal world that, as children, we always knew existed, had we only known where or how to look for it. <i>(Great read aloud for any age; written at a 9- to 12-year-old reading level)</i></p>Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run! The three meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat Boggis, squat Bunce, and skinny Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and his family surrounded. What they don?t know is that they?re not dealing with just any fox?Mr. Fox would never surrender. But only the most fantastic plan ever can save him now.</p><h2>Genes, girls, and Gamow</h2><p>In 1953 Watson and Crick discovered the double helical structure of DNA and Watson's personal account of the discovery, The Double Helix, was published in 1968.

The book is enlivened with copies of handwritten letters from the larger than life character George<br>Gamow, who had made significant contributions to physics but became intrigued by genes, RNA and the elusive genetic code. This is a tale of heartbreak, infidelity, scientific excitement and ambition, laced with travelogue and '50s atmosphere.</p><p>In 1953, while working at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the double helical structure of DNA.

It is barbara kingsolver&#39;s most accessible novel yet and explores the truths we live by and the complexities that lie behind them.</p><p><b>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2012:</b> In what may be the first novel to realistically imagine the near-term impact of &#x201c;global weirding,&#x201d; Barbara Kingsolver sets her latest story in rural Appalachia . In fictional Feathertown, Tennessee, Dellarobia Turnbow--on the run from her stifling life--charges up the mountain above her husband&#x2019;s family farm and stumbles onto a &#x201c;valley of fire&#x201d; filled with millions of monarch butterflies. This vision is deemed miraculous by the town&#x2019;s parishioners, then the international media. But when Ovid, a scientist who studies monarch behavior, sets up a lab on the Turnbow farm, he learns that the butterflies&#x2019; presence signals systemic disorder--and Dellarobia's in-laws&#x2019; logging plans won&#x2019;t help. Readers who bristle at politics made personal may be turned off by the strength of Kingsolver&#x2019;s convictions, but she never reduces her characters to mouthpieces, giving equal weight to climate science and human need, to forces both biological and biblical. Her concept of family encompasses all living beings, however ephemeral, and <i>Flight Behavior</i> gracefully, urgently contributes to the dialogue of survival on this swiftly tilting planet. --<i>Mari Malcolm</i><p><em>New York Times</em> Notable Book</p><p><em>Washington Post</em></p><p>Best Book Of The Year</p><p>Amazon's Top 100: Editor's Choice</p><p><em>Usa Today</em> Best Book Of The Year</p><p>Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man.</p><p>She hikes up a mountain road behind her house toward a secret tryst, but instead encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome.</p><p>As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.</p></p><h2>First Start Reading, Book B</h2><p><i>First Start Reading</i> covers consonants, short and long vowels, 45 common words, and manuscript printing, accompanied by artist-drawn coloring pictures and drawing pages for every letter.

Now, in her trademark outrageous style, Sarah Vowell argues that 1898 might be a year just as defining, when, in an orgy of imperialism, the United States annexed Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, and invaded first Cuba, then the Philippines, becoming an international superpower practically overnight.</p><p>Sarah Vowell is the bestselling author of <i>The Wordy Shipmates</i>, <i>Assassination Vacation</i>, <i>The Partly Cloudy Patriot</i>, <i>Take the Cannoli</i>, and <i>Radio On</i>. A contributing editor for public radio&#x2019;s "This American Life", she lives in New York City.Recounting the brief, remarkable history of a unified and independent Hawaii, Vowell, a public radio star and bestselling author (The Wordy Shipmates), retraces the impact of New England missionaries who began arriving in the early 1800s to remake the island paradise into a version of New England. In her usual wry tone, Vowell brings out the ironies of their efforts: while the missionaries tried to prevent prostitution with seamen and the resulting deadly diseases, the natives believed it was the missionaries who would kill them: "they will pray us all to death." Along the way, and with the best of intentions, the missionaries eradicated an environmentally friendly, laid-back native culture (although the Hawaiians did have taboos against women sharing a table with men, upon penalty of death, and a reverence for "royal incest"). Freely admitting her own prejudices, Vowell gives contemporary relevance to the past as she weaves in, for instance, Obama's boyhood memories. Outrageous and wise-cracking, educational but never dry, this book is a thought-provoking and entertaining glimpse into the U.S.'s most unusual state and its unanticipated twists on the familiar story of Americanization.

You'll discover:<br> Why the suppressed evidence proves Adolf Hitler didn't die before Germany surrendered during WWII, and how he eluded capture. How Nazi SS members, scientists, and soldiers escaped with Hitler to create colonies in other parts of the world to continue their monstrous research. Why in 1947 Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned that the US should adopt measures to protect against an invasion by hi-tech aircraft coming from the polar regions, adding, "The time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety." How, using advanced technology, Nazi saucers defeated the US military - long after WWII was supposedly over. Why the US space program was mostly a sham, and why the "UFOs" that started appearing around the world in the late 1940s were (and still are) most likely flown by Nazi pilots. How key government, manufacturing, pharmaceutical, financial leaders, and institutions helped Hitler come into power, and facilitated the preservation of Nazi wealth and power after WWII. Why today's world is secretly controlled by a malevolent shadow government and entire populations are being surreptitiously brainwashed. How ancient stargates have been duplicated to open portals into spiritual and demonic universes. Why those controlling our planet have laid the groundwork for a takeover by a dictator who could best be described as the Antichrist of the Bible. <br> Empire Beneath the Ice exposes the dangers our world faces, and will arm you with the tools you need to counter these unspeakable, secret evils.</p><p></p><h2>T&#39;ES BRANCHE?

It is the work written by Galileo in the last years of his life, while under house arrest by the Inquisition for suspected heresy. The two new sciences that comprise the subject of the book are the science of motion on earth and the study of the strength of materials. In presenting his findings, Galileo formulates a methodology for rigorous experimental study of natural phenomena that is the foundation for modern experimental science. <p>History of Free Fall, by Stillman Drake </p><p>Appended to Drake's translation and commentaries and bound in with them in the same volume is his monograph History of Free Fall: Aristotle to Galileo on the history of the discovery of the law of falling bodies, from its formulation by Aristotle to its clear statement by Galileo. Drake's painstaking research includes a close examination of Galileo's working papers which record his famous experiments with inclined planes and carefully controlled parabolic projectile paths.</p></p><p>Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was one of the founders of modern science. His work is a watershed between science as a philosophical discipline to science as the study of nature with its own methods and criteria. <p>The late Stillman Drake was Professor of the History of Science at the University of Toronto and the recognized world authority on the life and work of Galileo.

In this book, he drives it to the park but finds that a circus has taken up residence there. "Amos had never seen such a peculiar crowd. And they had never seen a dog drive a couch." Amos starts practicing with the other members of the circus, but when he gets home at night, he is so tired and lethargic that his owners, the Bobsons, begin to worry about him. On the day that he is told to stay home and nap, he sneaks out anyway, and ends up performing wonderful stunts at the circus. And the Bobsons, in the audience, understand that that their dog--and his couch--is no stranger to the big top. This is a far-fetched, funny follow-up, and this time the action takes place in full-color. Amos's antics are comically drawn--readers will love the pictures of him revving up for a trick. There seems no limit to what this dog--and his couch--can do.

The circus has come to town, and he is treated to all of its strange and peculiar sights, sounds, and people. No one there has ever seen a dog drive a couch before, and he becomes a celebrity in his own right. Adventures abound and Amos becomes the star attraction of the circus--much to the delight and surprise of his family sitting in the audience during the opening performance. A lively pace of text and exhuberant colorful cartoon illustrations combine to provide fun and fantasy for young browsers and readers.

The author resides in New England with her family.Kindergarten-Grade 3. While her mother serves a stint in the army, Korean-American Sumi, whose father is dead, lives with her harmuny (grandmother). The child longs for her mother's return, particularly as her birthday nears. Harmuny sits beside Sumi as she watches for a train and tells her the story of the "peacebound" train that saved her life and the lives of her two children (including Sumi's mother) during the communist invasion of Seoul in 1950. Harmuny also tells of her husband, Sumi's grandfather, who remained behind as a soldier and was never heard from again. Harmuny then hugs the girl and tells her that soon they will meet the train bringing her mother home "safe and sound." (Paradoxically, the illustration facing this final page of text portrays only Sumi's grandfather who did not return safe and sound.) The text, divided into short chapters, is gracefully written and told with great emotion. The richly colored illustrations are splashed with light, and convey the unfolding drama. Facial expressions are particularly effective. A brief glossary of Korean terms and an author's note about the history are appended. Readers will come away from this book with the understanding that the struggle for peace is universal and timeless, and that sometimes sacrifices must be made to achieve it.?Cynthia K. Richey, Mt.

Once again, Thom Jones seems less to write fiction than to allow his characters to pour their stories directly into the reader's ear. Here the cast includes some of the usual suspects--jittery fighters, Marines, Vietnam vets--as well as some new but equally quirky voices, from a nebbishy vice principal to a 92-year-old woman. First seen in Jones's debut collection, <i>The Pugilist at Rest</i>, the crack Marine recon team Break On Thru makes several more sorties--most notably in "Fields of Purple Forever," in which the civilian Sergeant Ondine takes up swimming much the same way Odysseus, say, took up sailing: "Ondine a night swimmer and he <i>all over</i> the night. Captain of the night. I swim in the fields of purple. Nothing and no one can harm me forever." "Tarantula" chronicles the rise and fall of John Harold Hammermeister, vice principal of W.E.B. Du Bois High School, where the students fail to be impressed by his caged spider and the frustrated janitors prove his undoing. "My Heroic Mythic Journey" follows the downward career arc of its boxer protagonist, who becomes featherweight champion of the world only to fall for a "bleach-bottle blond with a cheating heart" and a loaded .38. Most winning of all is the elderly narrator of "Daddy's Girl," who manages to preserve her faith even with two dead husbands, countless family tragedies, and eyelids growing up into her eyes: "You have to believe like a little child. Believe it because it's impossible." Only the overlong concluding story, "You Cheated, You Lied," disappoints; as chaotic as the main characters' mood swings, it follows two crazy teenagers in love and off their medication. But this tale is an exception in an otherwise noteworthy collection. <i>Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine</i> only confirms Jones's place as one of the most original American writers at work today. <i>--Mary Park</i>Thom Jones is the author of two previous short story collections, COLD SOUP and THE PUGILIST AT REST, a National Book Award finalist. His stories, including several in this collection, have appeared in such magazines as the New Yorker, Playboy, Esquire, GQ, and Harper&#39;s. He lives in Olympia, Washington, with his wife and daughter.</p><h2>Vin Scully I Saw It on the Radio (A Tribute Book)</h2><p>Millions of Dodger fans have known Vin Scully their entire lives even though they&#39;ve never met him.</p><p></p><h2>Playing for Real: The World of a Child Therapist</h2><p>A child psychologist explores the field of play therapy, offering overviews of children&#39;s emotional development and discussing such childhood problems as incest, attention deficit disorder, autism, and anxiety. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>A compilation of case histories of children in therapy, from a compassionate and incisive psychologist. Adult or child, we should all be lucky enough to have Bromfield (Psychology/Harvard Medical School) as a therapist. His willingness and ability to understand the emotional turmoil of troubled children and to let them play out their conflicts in his office set an extraordinary standard. ``Play'' is the operative word here. Puppets, dolls, clay, crayons, games, even guns and toy soldiers are the tools that allow psychologists entry into a child's often tumultuous psyche. As the author makes clear, children do not always do what they are expected to do, even with an array of childish treasures before them. On a first visit, seven-year-old Cory scoured the rug for fallen staples; teenaged Judy burrowed down inside her hooded sweatshirt, motionless and speechless for the first hour; fifth-grader Glen covered all the panes on the office's only window. Other patients include a boy diagnosed at school with what used to be called hyperactivity, and a six-year-old girl abused so badly as a toddler that she can only relate to others in a sexual way. More than a collection of readable stories about engaging--and some not so engaging-- patients, this book lays out the case for children's therapy. Along with a discussion of what qualities befit a child therapist--among them, patience and an ability to play--eloquent codicils to each chapter highlight Bromfield's belief that therapy is meant to heal, not to comfort, wounded children. Parents, teachers, and professionals will be informed and reassured by this view of play therapy for real children. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Blanchard's text describes the ancient means of navigation by the stars, winds, and sea currents, the later developments of the compass and sextant, and the more modern uses of radio beacons and satellites. Basic information on map reading, latitude, longitude, and Greenwich Mean Time is included. Peacock's handsome paintings show instruments, maps, landscapes, and ocean views. Hawcock's paper engineering gives three-dimensional versions of the Kon-Tiki, Endeavor, and one of Columbus' ships. A full-page model of a sextant has instructions on its use and mirrored flaps so that readers can try it themselves, while an astrolabe is shown, but not so well explained. The book concludes with a pop-up model of a satellite that is shown beaming a signal to a ship. Both satellite and ship are large in relation to the portion of the world that is shown. This book may be appropriate for social-studies classrooms, or even reference collections, where its use could be supervised, but the information presented can be found in other sources, making it a fragile luxury item for most libraries. --Jean H.

From the tapering, beautiful head stare two slanting eyes, crimson and moody. He is Elric, Emperor of Melnibone, cursed with a keen and cynical intelligence, schooled in the art of sorcery -- the hero of Michael Moorcock&#39;s remarkable epic of conflict and adventure at the dawn of human history. 5 CDs, almost 6 hours of AudioBooksPlus entertainment! Read by Jeff West. Included is a dramatic introduction read by Michael Moorcock over 10 mins in length.</p><p><i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> is a requisite title in the hard fantasy canon, a book no fantasy fan should leave unread. Author Michael Moorcock, already a major player in science fiction, cemented his position in the fantasy pantheon with the five-book Elric saga, of which <i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> is the first installment. The book's namesake, the brooding albino emperor of the dying nation of Melnibon�, is a sort of Superman for Goths, truly an archetype of the genre. <p> The youthful Elric is a cynical and melancholy king, heir to a nation whose 100,000-year rule of the world ended less than 500 years hence. More interested in brooding contemplation than holding the throne, Elric is a reluctant ruler, but he also realizes that no other worthy successor exists and the survival of his once-powerful, decadent nation depends on him alone. Elric's nefarious, brutish cousin Yrkoon has no patience for his physically weak kinsman, and he plots constantly to seize Elric's throne, usually over his dead body. <i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> follows Yrkoon's scheming, reaching its climax in a battle between Elric and Yrkoon with the demonic runeblades Stormbringer and Mournblade. In this battle, Elric gains control of the soul-stealing Stormbringer, an event that proves pivotal to the Elric saga. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Born in London in 1939, Michael Moorcock now lives in Texas.

It offers a handy, user-friendly format with tried and true suggestions.</p><p></p><h2>DeLorean</h2><p>The troubled automotive executive and maverick of the American car industry recalls the pursuit of his dream to build and sell the DeLorean Motor Car, the ultimate disaster of that venture and his arrest for drug-trafficking, and his newfound faith in Christ</p><p>These two books present antithetical views of John DeLorean, the controversial automotive celebrity. DeLorean focuses on the car maker's drug arrest, his acquittal, and his evolution as a born-again Christian. It tells little about the ill-fated sports car. The naivete DeLorean conveys and his simplistic explanations at times seem implausible coming from a man of his stature. Hard Driving is an unflattering picture of DeLorean written by his former public relations director. Haddad presents a lucid picture of DeLorean's convoluted financial dealings and complicated political relationships with the governments of England and Northern Ireland. The DeLorean of Hard Driving is devious, amoral, and a ruthless man. For the auto historian or business student, Haddad's is the more valuable work. Both books have a place in public libraries.

Everything in our world says it is not. God says that it is. Though the world in which we live has changed, it is plain that the sins of the flesh have not. Pleasures seduce us at every turn, selfish desires cry out for fulfillment. Yet in the midst of ever increasing moral decay, God calls us to be holy. It seems impossible, but perhaps we have a misconception of holiness. Perhaps holiness is more than conforming to a set of outward standards. Could it involve the heart? Passion for the Father? Unquenchable thirst for His life? Bestselling author Floyd McClung takes a penetrating look at why it is so difficult to be holy in our modern world. He examines the forces in our culture that keep us from pursuing holiness and provides a blueprint for victorious living in our secular age.</p><p></p><h2>Just Being at the Piano</h2><p>&#34;...Works toward developing the musician&#39;s sensory awareness of the sound, of the touch, of what the entire body is experiencing, so that each tone may sing.&#34; - Lee Strasberg</p><p></p><h2>Things Fall Apart (Modern Critical Interpretations Series)</h2><p>A critical overview of the work features the writings of Richard Begam, Rhonda Cobham, Emmanuel Edame Egar, Clement Okafor, Richard K.

Linda Fairstein brings readers inside a world of which they can't get enough, but one they hope to never see in real life. <br><br> And for her twelfth novel, Fairstein takes Alexandra Cooper inside a world <i>she'd</i> rather not see. <br><br> New York City politics have always been filled with intrigue and behind-the-scenes deals. In <i>Hell Gate</i>, Alex finds her attention torn between investigating a shipwreck that has contraband cargo-human cargo-and the political sex scandal of a promising New York congressman now fallen from grace. When Alex discovers that a woman from the wreck and the congressman's lover have the same rose tattoo-the brand of a "snakehead", a master of a human trafficking operation-it dawns on her that these cases aren't as unrelated as they seem and that the entire political landscape of New York City could hang in the balance of her investigation. As Alex looks on at the nameless victims in the morgue, she realizes she's looking at the present-day face of New York's long, dark tradition of human trafficking-a tradition that began hundreds of years ago with slave trade from Africa, now a multimillion-dollar industry that will stop at no cost, even if that cost is Alex's life.<br><br>Watch a Video<p> </p></p><p><p>Linda Fairstein was chief of the Sex Crimes Unit of the district attorney&#x2019;s office in Manhattan for more than two decades and is America&#x2019;s foremost legal expert on sexual assauly and domestic violence.

Although this doesn&#x2019;t get it off to a particularly pleasant start.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got her from here, pal,&#x201d; Mike said, dismissing the cop. &#x201c;You warm enough?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Battaglia called me at home this morning,&#x201d; I said, referring to my boss, the district attorney of New York County. &#x201c;Did you just arrive?&#x201d;</p><p>We were both dressed in jeans. I had a cashmere sweater under my ski jacket, with gloves and a scarf to protect myself against the brisk January day. Mike wore a white turtleneck beneath his trademark navy blazer. The winter cold never bothered him, any more than the sight of a corpse.</p><p>&#x201c;Nope. Human trafficking&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t get worse scumbags than the guys who deal in flesh. All the squads got called in right away. Every borough,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I was doing a midnight so I shot out here from a crack den in Harlem. Just went back to the car now to get my shades. The glare on the water&#x2019;s a killer.&#x201d;</p><p>Mike was one of the best detectives in the city, assigned to Manhattan North Homicide, which handled every case from Fifty-ninth Street to the northern tip of the island. We&#x2019;d been professional partners&#x2014;and close friends&#x2014;for more than a decade.</p><p>&#x201c;Where do you want to start?&#x201d; he asked me. People were swarming across the beach like armies of insects. &#x201c;The tent over there to the left on that paved area&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the temporary morgue.</p><p></p><p>The group in the middle, we&#x2019;ve got more than a hundred victims off the wreck so far, trying to get them in dry clothes.

Your buddy from the task force, Donovan Baynes. His group is trying to set up a command center on the right. Hardest thing,&#x201d; Mike said, starting down the slope, &#x201c;is holding the press at bay. Roping them off on the street is easy, but keeping the helicopters and power boats away is more of a problem, now that news has spread.

What makes him think he has jurisdiction here?&#x201d; Mike&#x2019;s loafers made a crunching sound as they pounded the sand while we toured the scene. His straight black hair, gleaming in the sunlight, was blowing wildly as he walked into the wind.</p><p>&#x201c;Global and mobile. That&#x2019;s how he likes to think of himself. He&#x2019;s been DA for so long he doesn&#x2019;t believe there&#x2019;s anything that limits him,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why he fought so hard to get me on the task force.&#x201d;</p><p>Human trafficking, a modern-day form of slavery, wasn&#x2019;t even on the books until federal laws addressing it were enacted in 2000. Before that, prosecutors had patched together local legislation to attempt to punish the handful of individuals who could be linked to efforts to transport victims across borders, coercing them to work at everything from agricultural labor to child prostitution.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Counselor,&#x201d; a detective greeted me as we approached the group of men encircling Donovan Baynes. &#x201c;Chapman, how many interpreters did you call for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A boatload. Why? How many you got so far?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two. Only two have showed up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What language?&#x201d; I asked, trying to process the sight of scores </p><p>of dazed victims who were wrapped in blankets, staring out at the shipwreck, undoubtedly looking for family members and friends.</p><p>&#x201c;Ukrainian,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;Why? You ever do a Ukrainian, kid? A little pillow talk and your Ukrainian could be almost as good as your French.&#x201d;</p><p>I had just returned from Paris two days earlier&#x2014;on Monday&#x2014;where I spent the New Year holiday with my lover, Luc Rouget. The more about my personal life I kept from Mike, the more he needled me. &#x201c;No surprise. Since the Soviet collapse, Ukraine leads Eastern Europe in the number of trafficking victims.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want me to do about it, Chapman?&#x201d; the detective asked. &#x201c;We got to move these guys off the beach before they freeze their balls off. Sorry, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s gonna freeze today. It&#x2019;s almost fifty degrees,&#x201d; Mike said, not breaking his stride. &#x201c;Send some cars over to Little Odessa. Go to a few coffee shops and grab anybody who&#x2019;s sitting still.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Brighton Beach. Right next door, in Brooklyn. You&#x2019;re like Coop&#x2014;you need a road map to the Outer Boroughs.&#x201d;</p><p>Brighton had been built as a local beach resort in the 1860s, named for the English coastal town in a contest held by its developers. In the 1970s, it was nicknamed Little Odessa because of the large concentration of immigrants from that Black Sea city, once one of the great ports of Imperial Russia.</p><p>Donovan Baynes waved as he saw us approaching. I&#x2019;d known the forty-one-year-old since his days as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of the U.S. Attorney&#x2019;s Office. He was surrounded by four men, three of them agents I recognized from our task force meetings. &#x201c;Hurry up, Alex. Glad you&#x2019;re here. I think you know everybody.&#x201d;</p><p>I shook hands and introduced myself to the unfamiliar man. He appeared to be in his early fifties, barefoot and dressed in a wetsuit that was sculpted to his well-muscled body. &#x201c;Hi, I&#x2019;m Alexandra Cooper. Manhattan District Attorney&#x2019;s Office.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stu Carella. Used to be homicide, NYPD. Guess you don&#x2019;t remember me, but we met at a few crime scenes when I was still on the job. The dancer at the Met, the broad who was kidnapped at Fort Tilden,&#x201d; he said, then nodded at Mike. &#x201c;I see she&#x2019;s still stalking you, Chapman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My order of protection expired, Stu. I asked the judge to keep her three hundred feet away and to tell her to stop stealing my underwear, but she&#x2019;s out of control again. Be careful, man, Coop&#x2019;s a sucker for guys in tights.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me bring you up to speed, Alex,&#x201d; Baynes said, ignoring Mike&#x2019;s chatter as he put his arm around my shoulder. He&#x2019;d been around the two of us enough to know this was standard operating procedure for Mike. Behind us were the high-rise buildings of the Rockaways&#x2014;mostly nursing homes at this end&#x2014;and the smaller residences that bordered the beach. &#x201c;About five of the vics have been debriefed. The ship left Sevastopol more than a month ago, with close to three hundred people on board, mainly men, but at least thirty women and children.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked out at the decrepit cargo ship, amazed that it had made it here from Europe.</p><p>&#x201c;Smugglers find the villagers living the most desperate lives, promise them jobs and a better life in America. Take every nickel they&#x2019;ve managed to save, claiming to use it to feed them on the trip. Bribe officials. You know all that. They trucked these folks from small towns all over their country and loaded them into sweltering holds on board the ship, then began dodging immigration police throughout the Mediterranean.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They got all this way only to run aground here and die within sight of land,&#x201d; I said. The stories I&#x2019;d heard from trafficking victims were heartbreaking, but at least those who were rescued by law enforcement agencies often had a second chance.</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t an accident,&#x201d; Baynes continued, turning to his deputy. &#x201c;The leader of the operation in New York&#x2014;well, what do you call a snakehead in Ukrainian?&#x201d;</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;A friggin&#x2019; snakehead, Donny,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;You brainiacs got to go to law school to figure that out? It&#x2019;s the same in any language.&#x201d;</p><p>Ages ago, the Chinese perfected the ugly practice of smuggling human beings, called snakes, for slave labor. Ringleaders of the inhumane syndicates had long been known as snakeheads.</p><p>&#x201c;The boss of the operation is somewhere in this city. When the captain got close to shore just after midnight, he radioed his contact, who was supposed to send a small fleet of speedboats out to pick up the passengers,&#x201d; Baynes went on. &#x201c;Two, three hours went by and no sign of escorts. Apparently, the anxiety level of the immigrants who&#x2019;d been pigeonholed for weeks went over the top. The first handful of men had been brought up on deck to be unloaded, and one of them got frantic when he saw a vessel with government markings coming toward them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coast Guard?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t gotten that far, Alex. No agency we know of has claimed yet that they tried to intercept the ship.&#x201d;</p><p>Mike picked up the story. &#x201c;That first group just went berserk and staged a mutiny, according to two of the guys who made it ashore. They locked the captain in his cabin with a few of the other managers. Some of the men were in such despair about being caught by immigration that they started jumping overboard to swim in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That water must be frigid,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Frigid? Don&#x2019;t go showing off your area of expertise, Coop. That&#x2019;s why we hauled Stu out of retirement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like I was just telling Donovan,&#x201d; Carella said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the Polar Bear Club here at Coney Island. We swim every Sunday, all winter long. Just had our big New Year&#x2019;s party five days ago. Not so bad for the Atlantic. Forty-three degrees. Some hypothermia, maybe. Everybody will be watching out for that today. Cold water doesn&#x2019;t have to be fatal, Alex.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But at least six people have died.&#x201d;</p><p>Carella shook his head. &#x201c;Probably drowned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Drowned? The ship is so close to shore. The water isn&#x2019;t even that deep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Panic kills, Coop. Everybody who works on water knows that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Panic?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you believe it? Not all the peasants in Europe grew up with a pool in the backyard like you did, princess.&#x201d;</p><p>Shouts went up from the crowd of victims and several of them broke through a line of cops, running almost thirty yards eastward to the water&#x2019;s edge. Stu Carella dashed after the frantic young men and passed beyond them as he dove into the surf, where something that looked like a large rag doll was lifted again and flopped around by a tall wave that kept licking at the sand. He and three cops in scuba gear grabbed and carried another body onto the beach. One of the men immediately crouched in an effort to resuscitate the limp corpse.</p><p>I started after them and Donovan Baynes pulled me back. &#x201c;Let it be, Alex. They know what they&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How many do you think jumped ship?&#x201d; I wanted to make myself useful, but all the specialized squads of the NYPD were well-trained for this kind of disaster.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s impossible to get an accurate count at this point. One fellow they&#x2019;ve talked to explained that when the mutineers began to struggle with the captain, he tried to steer the damn thing away from shore, back out into the open sea. Making that turn, he ran the ship aground on a shallow sandbar. Some of the victims figured they were so close to the beach they could reach land&#x2014;even several who didn&#x2019;t know how to swim. Maybe twenty jumped. Maybe forty. Nobody seems to know yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The men you&#x2019;ve talked to, do they know where they thought they were going?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody told them the truth, Alex. It&#x2019;s the usual scam,&#x201d; Donovan said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been there&#x2014;people who don&#x2019;t see a future for themselves and want to believe in a dream, but wake up in the middle of a nightmare. Countrymen were supposed to meet them right here in Queens and bring them into their homes until they&#x2019;re placed in jobs&#x2014;mostly agricultural ones&#x2014;in farms upstate and in the Midwest. Those would be the men, the lucky ones.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The young women would become your territory,&#x201d; Mike said.</p><p>I had seen this time after time in my role as chief sex crimes prosecutor in the DA&#x2019;s office&#x2014;girls abducted from their homes in Thailand or Montenegro, running away from abusive parents and desolate lives in Sri Lanka or Serbia, smuggled across borders in car trunks or leaky boats, often following their brothers or schoolmates, hoping that hard work and physical labor would eventually gain them the freedom of a new life in the States.</p><p>But the girls rarely made it to farmlands and fields. The sex trade had become a huge transnational industry, as lucrative as it could be deadly. The teenagers on the Golden Voyage were doubtless bound for basements and brothels, to be broken in by their owners for the months and years of prostitution that awaited them in the promised land.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there any way to identify these victims?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No better than usual. Each one is supposed to have a piece of paper with his or her family name and town of origin in their pockets when they ship out,&#x201d; Baynes said. &#x201c;Most of them tossed or swallowed the paper as the police launches arrived. The brother of one of the dead girls is among the few who are talking. He dove in and she tried to follow.&#x201d;</p><p>A lanky man sat at the corner of the tented morgue, with a gray blanket covering his head and upper body. I couldn&#x2019;t tell whether he was shaking from the cold or because he was crying so hard.</p><p>Stu Carella was making his way back to us, refusing the offer of an NYPD sweatshirt that one of the cops thrust at him.</p><p>&#x201c;Another kid gone,&#x201d; Carella said, throwing a tuft of algae at the ground in disgust. &#x201c;Probably drowned in three feet of water, unable to handle the pull of the rip.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;From his hand?&#x201d; Mike knelt down and picked up the slimy green vegetation with the tip of his pen.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>Mike whistled and the closest cops looked up. He signaled one, who jogged to us. &#x201c;Carry this over to the medical examiner. Goes with that latest body.&#x201d;</p><p>The fact that the victim had been clutching algae, and I&#x2019;d bet a handful of sand, as he was dragged across the ocean floor meant that he had been alive when he went into the water. Drowning, I had learned over the years, was a diagnosis of exclusion. A complete autopsy would be necessary for each of the Golden Voyagers who had wa...</p></p><h2>Small Gas Engines</h2><p>Designed to provide students, do-it-yourselfers, and aspiring technicians with practical information about small gas engine theory, construction, operation, lubrication, maintenance, troubleshooting, service, rebuilding, and repair.

Author Charles E. Zech explores more than just the impact of stewardship on parish income he also analyzes time and talent contributions, measuring everything from volunteer activity to Mass attendance to outreach programs like prison ministries or soup kitchen sponsorship.

When President George Washington appointed Wayne to command the Legion of the United States, he granted him unlimited powers to conduct a military campaign against the Indian confederacy of the Ohio River Valley. <p>In <i>Bayonets in the Wilderness</i>, Alan D. Gaff explores this long-neglected period in American history to tell the complete story of how the U.S. Army conquered the first American frontier. Wayne's successful campaign led to the creation of a standing army for the country and set the standard for future conflicts and treaties with American Indians. Countering the popular impression of Wayne as "mad," Gaff depicts him as a thoughtful, resolute, and diplomatic officer whose masterfully organized campaign brought an end to forty years of border fighting. </p><p>In this detailed, definitive military history, Gaff documents the British and French influence, the famed battle at Fallen Timbers, and the Treaty of Greeneville, which ended hostilities in the region. His account brings to light alliances between Indian forces and the British military, demonstrating that British troops still conducted operations on American soil long after the supposed end of the American Revolution. </p><p>Volume 4 in the Campaigns &amp; Commanders series</p></p><p><b>Alan D.

But he persisted, and the result was a chapter&#x2014;"A Plantation by the Sea"&#x2014;that inspired this powerful sequel.In The Northside, Johnson brings the untold story of Atlantic City's black community vividly to life, from the arrival of the first African Americans to Absecon Island in the early 19th century through the glory days of the "World's Playground." Drawing on dozens of personal interviews and painstaking archival research, he reveals long-forgotten details about the people on whose backs the gambling mecca was built and offers a wide-ranging survey of the accomplishments of more recent generations.Exploited for their labor and banished to the most undesirable part of town, resilient Northsiders created a vibrant city within a city&#x2014;a place where black culture could thrive and young people could aspire to become artists, athletes, educators, and leaders of business, politics, and society. As Nelson Johnson shows in this unflinching portrait, Atlantic City was built on their toil&#x2014;and the Northside was born of their dreams.</p><p>Nelson Johnson, whose family&#39;s presence in Atlantic County predates the founding of Atlantic City, is a lifelong resident of Hammonton, New Jersey. He practiced law for 30 years and was active in Atlantic City and Atlantic County politics through much of that period.Johnson&#39;s previous book, Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City, inspired the critically acclaimed HBO series from Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter.</p><h2>Facing Death in Cambodia</h2><p>The Khmer Rouge regime took control of Cambodia by force of arms, then committed the most brazen crimes since the Third Reich: at least 1.5 million people murdered between 1975 and 1979. Yet no individuals were ever tried or punished. This book is the story of Peter Maguire's effort to learn how Cambodia's "culture of impunity" developed, why it persists, and the failures of the "international community" to confront the Cambodian genocide. Written from a personal and historical perspective, <i>Facing Death in Cambodia</i> recounts Maguire's growing anguish over the gap between theories of universal justice and political realities.<br><br>Maguire documents the atrocities and the aftermath through personal interviews with victims and perpetrators, discussions with international and NGO officials, journalistic accounts, and government sources gathered during a ten-year odyssey in search of answers. The book includes a selection of haunting pictures from among the thousands taken at the now infamous Tuol Sleng prison (also referred to as S-21), through which at least 14,000 men, women, and children passed&#x2015;and from which fewer than a dozen emerged alive.<br><br>What he discovered raises troubling questions: Was the Cambodian genocide a preview of the genocidal civil wars that would follow in the wake of the Cold War? Is international justice an attainable idea or a fiction superimposed over an unbearably dark reality? Did issues of political expediency allow Cambodian leaders to escape prosecution?The Khmer Rouge violated the Nuremberg Principles, the United Nations Charter, the laws of war, and the UN Genocide Convention. Yet in the decade after the regime's collapse, the perpetrators were rescued and rehabilitated-even rewarded-by China, Thailand, the United States, and the UN. According to Peter Maguire, Cambodia holds the key to understanding why recent UN interventions throughout the world have failed to prevent atrocities and to enforce treaties.</p><p>This book is the story of Peter Maguire's effort to learn how Cambodia's "culture of impunity" developed, why it persists, and the failures of the "international community" to confront the Cambodian genocide.

With a special focus on the bond between little Jay Jay and his grannie, Trish Cooke introduces us to a gregarious family we are sure to want more, more, more of.</p><p>Trish Cooke is the author of numerous books for children, including the award-winning SO MUCH, illustrated by Helen Oxenbury, and THE GRANDAD TREE, illustrated by Sharon Wilson. Of FULL, FULL, FULL OF LOVE, she says, "Sunday dinner is just another excuse for my family to party. And believe me, we do! On Sunday Mom&#x2019;s house is always full. It&#x2019;s like musical chairs sometimes because you can guarantee that if you get up from your chair, someone else will have filled it by the time you get back! The best thing is there are always lots of hugs to go around!"<br>Paul Howard has illustrated many books for young people, including THE OWL WHO WAS AFRAID OF THE DARK by Jill Tomlinson and CLASSIC POETRY: AN ILLUSTRATED COLLECTION, edited by Michael Rosen. Of FULL, FULL, FULL OF LOVE, he says, "Jay Jay&#x2019;s Sunday reminds me of my own nan&#x2019;s mammoth Sunday dinners when I was a child. From behind your shoulder Nan would always put more food on your plate - despite the helpless pleas, &#x2018;No more! No more!&#x2019; "Cooke's (So Much) rhythmic prose hits a magical note between chant and lullaby, and her tale conveys a bone-deep understanding of how children cherish familial ties. As Jay Jay helps his grandmother prepare for the extended family's Sunday dinner, he finds a comforting, often palpable abundance everywhere he looks. Grannie herself is "soft and warm and full,/ full of hugs and kisses./ Kiss, kiss./ Hugs and cuddles." When Grannie distracts an increasingly hungry Jay Jay with a visit to her fish tank, he notices that it, too, is "full,/ full of all kinds of fishes./ Splash, splish./ Wiggle, wiggle." Howard's (The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark) artwork throughout the book has an expansive, unbuttoned feel, but the spread for this latter vignette is particularly striking: he contrasts the grandmother and grandson's warm, coffee-toned skin and soft, chocolate eyes with the tropically-hued array swimming in front of them. When dinner finally appears on the table, Cooke shifts to rhyming couplets that fairly telegraph Jay Jay's anticipation ("There were buttery peas,/ chicken and yams,/ macaroni and cheese,/ potatoes and ham"). Howard similarly turns the mouth-watering meal into a feast for the eyes. Readers will find themselves joining Jay Jay in contentedly savoring the way a gathering of loved ones feels deliciously big and complete.

Meanwhile, Adam Krupp wakes up, Brenda Heath brushes her teeth, and Christopher Beaker finds his sneaker. Miss Bindergarten puts the finishing touches on the room just in time, and the students arrive. Now the fun can begin!&nbsp;<br><br>"Multifaceted and appealing, this book can be enjoyed in many ways, at home and at school." --<b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br></b>For readers of <i>Kindergarten, Here I Come </i>and <i>The Night Before Kindergarten.</i></p><p>On the first day of kindergarten, Miss Bindergarten must prepare her classroom for her beloved students. This noble, whimsical teacher greets her dark, summertime-empty classroom with an explosion of color--a bouquet of fall leaves, a goldfish, rolled-up posters, and shoeboxes full of no-doubt-delightful surprises. Meanwhile, her young students get ready, too: "<b>A</b>dam Krupp wakes up. <b>B</b>renda Heath brushes her teeth. <b>C</b>hristopher Beaker finds his sneaker." Author Joseph Slate matches each animal character with a letter of the alphabet, and readers can flip to the back to discover that Adam is an alligator, Brenda is a beaver, and Christopher is a cat--and so on, through the more obscure animals such as the quokka and the Uakari monkey. Youngsters will relish the scenes of school preparation, adorned by rhyming text: a mother iguana dragging her son Ian Lowe (who cries "I won't go!") out the front door, and the little vole Vicki Densel biting her pencil. And of course Miss Bindergarten is the kindergarten teacher we either remember fondly or wish we had. The final back-to-school classroom scene explodes with love and pride and the smell of freshly sharpened pencils.

A Shark!: All About Sharks (Cat in the Hat&#39;s Learning Library)</h2><p>In this latest installment of the Cat in the Hat's Learning Library, the Cat introduces beginning readers to all kinds of sharks! From the smallest (the dwarf lantern) to the largest (the whale shark), the most notorius (the great white) to the most obscure (the goblin), the Cat explains why sharks have lots of teeth but no bones; how their tough skin helps them swim fast and stay clean (inspiring scientists--and bathing suit manufacturers!); how pores along the sides of their bodies help them sense prey; that they have more to fear from us than we do from them, and much, much more!

"See this wonderful boat bobbing here on the water?/It's my Super-Stupendous Shipshape Shark Spotter" is one of the better-scanning lines, but still is a clunky read. Written at an almost fourth-grade reading level and illustrated in a cartoon style, the book's intended audience is unclear. Older students would be better served by reading a nonfiction text about sharks, many of which are listed in the back matter, including David Doubilet and Jennifer Hayes's Face to Face With Sharks (National Geographic, 2009).

Ramsay will offer simple, accessible recipes with a "wow" factor. Gordon has travelled the world from India and the Far East to LA and Europe, and the recipes in this book will draw all these culinary influences together to show us simple, vibrant and delicious recipes that reflect the way we eat today. For example: Miso braised salmon fillet with Asian vegetables, Pork and Bacon slider with home made bbq sauce, Curried Sweetcorn Soup, Wild Mushroom Risotto Arrancini, and Baked Lemon Cheesecake with Raspberries. <br><br>Each chapter will concentrate on a different area of cooking--from the classics to the secret of cooking with Chili and spice, through roasting, baking, and helpful sections on cooking good food for less and cooking for a crowd. Woven into the book will be useful tricks and tips--from ways to save time and money, to cleaning and prepping ingredients, to pan frying like a pro. <br><br>Stuffed full of delicious recipes, invaluable tips and lashings of Gordon's trademark cheeky wit, Gordon Ramsay's Home Cooking is the ultimate cooking lesson from the ultimate chef.</p><p>Gordon Ramsay is a world-renowned chef who was awarded 3 Michelin stars for his <em>Restaurant Gordon Ramsay </em>in London. As one of only four chefs in the UK to maintain three stars, Gordon was awarded an OBE in 2006 for services to the industry. Now internationally recognized, Gordon has opened a string of successful restaurants across the globe, from Italy to LA. He also has two top rated shows: <em>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</em> and <em>Hell's Kitchen</em>. His latest show, <em>Masterchef US</em>, is now in its second season, and he is slated to star in a new series, Hotel Hell, slated to air in June 2012. Gordon has also published a number of books, many of which have become best sellers like <em>Gordon Ramsay Makes It Easy</em> to his autobiography, <em>Roasting in Hell's Kitchen</em>.Food-television enthusiasts familiar with Ramsay&#x2019;s tough and abrasive broadcast personality may not think of him as a home cook, but the chef sets himself to prove that good cooking need not be complicated or unattainable for the domestic market. He scales beef Wellington back to something more affordable by eliminating foie gras in favor of ham. Coconut pancakes get an added tropical touch topped with mango slices and lime syrup. A hefty dose of chili peppers cuts lamb shanks&#x2019; customary richness. Ramsay&#x2019;s cuisine draws on many traditions. Szechuan peppercorns spice chicken thighs, and chipotle peppers enhance ears of corn in the style of Mexican street vendors. Jamaican jerk chicken lacks no little fire, and even Ramsay&#x2019;s chocolate mousse has a bit of chili. A section with recipes to serve just two can impress a date with seemingly effortless cooking. Ramsay&#x2019;s media presence will boost demand for this volume. --Mark Knoblauch</p><h2>Clifford the Big Red Dog (Classic Storybook)</h2><p><b>It only takes a little to be BIG!</b><br><br>Meet Clifford and Emily Elizabeth in the original Clifford book!

If you have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques; and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about. It&#x2019;s about learning to pay attention.&#x201d;<br><b>--Anne Lamott, Mademoiselle</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The premise of the book is that creativity and spirituality are the same thing, they come from the same place. And we were created to use this life to express our individuality, and that over the course of a lifetime that gets beaten out of us. [<b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b>] helped me put aside my fear and not worry about whether the record would be commercial.&#x201d;<br><b>--Grammy award-winning singer Kathy Mattea</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Julia Cameron brings creativity and spirituality together with the same kind of step-by-step wisdom that Edgar Cayce encouraged. The result is spiritual creativity as a consistent and nourishing part of daily life.&#x201d;<br><b>--Venture Inward</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I never knew I was a visual artist until I read Julia Cameron&#x2019;s <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b>.&#x201d;<br><b>--Jannene Behl in Artist&#x2019;s Magazine</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Julia Cameron&#x2019;s landmark book <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b> helped me figure out who I really was as an adult, not so much as an artist but as a person. And award-winning journalist and poet, Cameron&#x2019;s genius is that she doesn&#x2019;t tell readers what they should do to achieve or who they should be&#x2014;instead she creates a map for readers to start exploring these questions themselves.&#x201d;<br><b>--Michael F. Melcher, Law Practice magazine</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This is not a self-help book in the normative sense. It is simply a powerful book that can challenge one to move into an entirely different state of personal expression and growth.&#x201d;<br><b>--Nick Maddox, Deland Beacon</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b> (with its companion volume <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY MORNING PAGES JOURNAL</b>) becomes a friend over time, not just a journal. Like a journal, it provokes spontaneous insights and solutions; beyond journaling, it establishes a process that is interactive and dynamic.&#x201d;<br><b>--Theresa L. Crenshaw, M.D., San Diego Union-Tribune</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;If you really want to supercharge your writing, I recommend that you get a copy of Julia Cameron&#x2019;s book <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b>. I&#x2019;m not a big fan of self-help books, but this book has changed my life for the better and restored my previously lagging creativity.&#x201d;<br><b>--Jeffrey Bairstow, Laser Focus World</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Working with the principle that creative expression is the natural direction of life, Cameron developed a three month program to recover creativity. <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b> shows how to tap into the higher power that connects human creativity and the creative energies of the universe.&#x201d;<br><b>--Mike Gossie, Scottsdale Tribune</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY </b>is the seminal book on the subject of creativity and an invaluable guide to living the artistic life. Still as vital today&#x2014;or perhaps even more so&#x2014;than it was when it was first published in 1992, it is a provocative and inspiring work. Updated and expanded, it reframes <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b> for a new century.&#x201d;<br><b>--Branches of Light</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY has sold over 3 million copies since its publication in 1992. Cameron still teaches it because there is sustained demand for its thoughtful, spiritual approach to unblocking and nurturing creativity. It is, dare we say, timeless.&#x201d;<br><b>--Nancy Colasurdo, FOXBusiness<br><br><b>Praise for VEIN OF GOLD, the second volume in the ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY trilogy</b><br>&nbsp;</b><br>&#x201c;For those seeking the wellspring of creativity, this book, like its predecessor, is a solid gold diving rod.&#x201d;<br><b><b>--PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</b></b></p><h2>Goosebumps Retro Scream Collection: Limited Edition Tin</h2><p><b>Five of the all-time bestselling Goosebumps books with their original covers in an exclusive collectible retro tin!</b><br><br>Reader beware--it's the original scare!<br><br>Five of the all-time bestselling Goosebumps books including <i>Welcome to Dead House</i>, <i>Say Cheese And Die!</i>, <i>Night of the Living Dummy</i>, <i>The Haunted Mask</i>, and <i>One Day at HorrorLand</i>.

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense. <p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>That Alice. When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here. "'What is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures?'" What indeed?

They&#x2019;re like campers in a forest who spot a grizzly and scramble up a tree to hide. (Or, in this case, climb into a locker.) I&#x2019;ve been called the Mastodon of Montgomery Middle, the Springfield Skyscraper, the Moving Mountain, the Terrible Tower, the . . . You get the idea.<br>These names bothered me in sixth grade when I was excited to start middle school and make friends. But now, in eighth grade, my size has become a profit center. And business is booming.<br>Take these two kids sitting down in the back corner of the library (my office), fidgeting like I&#x2019;m going to eat them or something. One has practically chewed off his fingernails, and the other one&#x2019;s leg won&#x2019;t stop bouncing.<br> I hear them whispering.<br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I say.<br> &#x201c;Is it true?&#x201d; the kid asks. &#x201c;That you carried forty two chairs to the auditorium? By yourself?&#x201d;<br> I stare. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> Actually it was only eight chairs, but these are the kinds of rumors that are good for business.<br> &#x201c;Incredible.&#x201d;<br> They start whispering to each other again.<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re wondering if we could procure your walking services, Mr. Marcus?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call me that.&#x201d;<br> At the start of the school year, a bunch of sixth graders confused me for a teacher while they were trying to find the auditorium. I told them they&#x2019;d better figure out where they needed to go or I was going to collect a tax from them for getting in the way. They ran. Soon a rumor started spreading that I was really an undercover assistant principal hired to keep kids in line. It&#x2019;s kind of ridiculous, but things at Montgomery often are.<br> The rumors about me have gone from fantastical (Godzilla with a crew cut) to realistic (assistant principal). It&#x2019;s really annoying. But like I said, I&#x2019;ve found a way to make it work for me. These two kids are here for my walking service, the crown jewel of my business.<br> &#x201c;Five bucks a week to walk each of you to school,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;And five bucks to get you home. Your total invoice is ten per week.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Each of us?&#x201d; The kid seems surprised.<br> &#x201c;I could walk you halfway for half the price.&#x201d;<br> They look at each other a moment.<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my blue-plate special,&#x201d; I say.<br> &#x201c;No, we&#x2019;ll take the whole service. Thank you.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Where do you live?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I live on Maple and Vine,&#x201d; one kid says.<br> The other kid chimes in with, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on Vine and North Cherry Hill Drive.&#x201d;<br> I already walk four other kids who live in the Cherry Hill neighborhood, so two more isn&#x2019;t a big deal. I can&#x2019;t charge them more than ten bucks, or parents will start to wonder. The way I see it, it&#x2019;s a win-win for everyone. I&#x2019;m making some money, and these kids are getting protection from bullying on their walks to and from school. I&#x2019;m doing a service. People pay for bodyguards all the time. That&#x2019;s what I am to these kids&#x2014;a big, bad bodyguard.<br> &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I tell them before they run off to class.<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a deposit. Five bucks each.&#x201d;<br> I always take a deposit for my services. It&#x2019;s like insurance money. They both pull out fives and hand them to me. Then they quickly get out of my office.<br> Most of my business transactions happen in the small cubicle located behind a shelf at the far end of the library. The school librarian lets me hang there whenever I want. I usually take a stack of books to read while I wait for my &#x201c;clients.&#x201d; In exchange for the office space, I help the librarian shelve books.<br> I carefully fold the cash into my pocket and pull out my business spiral from my backpack to write down the names of my new clients. I check my cell phone storage tab before I close it. I need to pick up the slack on that. I&#x2019;ve only collected two cell phones today. That&#x2019;s just three bucks.<br> Here at Montgomery, there is zero cell phone use during school hours. Kids were getting their phones stolen and/or thrown into the lunchtime garbage can by older kids. (Trust me, you don&#x2019;t want your cell phone tossed in there. I don&#x2019;t even put my own garbage in there.) Besides all of that, Principal Jenkins said students were &#x201c;spending too much time texting and using social media.&#x201d;<br> Some parents cheered Principal Jenkins&#x2019;s decision. Others, not so much. In the end, a compromise was made. Kids could have a phone in their lockers but were not permitted to carry them around, and they definitely could not have them in class.<br> Around mid-September, two seventh graders bumped into me because they were texting each other while walking to class. They tried to apologize, but I saw an opportunity. I decided to take their phones and charge them a &#x201c;storage fee&#x201d; until school got out. I let them come to my locker, send a text or two, then return the phones until they left school. I&#x2019;ve collected phones one hundred and twenty-seven times since school started. That&#x2019;s almost two hundred bucks.<br> I look at another tab in my portfolio. <br> garbage tax collection (year two)<br> week 25 = $2<br> Business is way down. I started collecting a garbage tax last year when kids kept dumping stuff on the floor, leaving empty soda cans in the library or crumpled paper in classrooms. It became so bad, Principal Jenkins said he would give detention to any student caught littering on school grounds. That&#x2019;s how the garbage tax was born.<br> The idea came to me when I was sitting in my office and I heard a couple of kids chatting. I stood and peeked over the shelves to find a boy and girl had sneaked two sodas into the library. They finished, left the cans on a shelf, and took a few books to the circulation desk.<br> I walked over, grabbed the evidence, and waited for them outside.<br> The girl was surprised to see me standing there. She stepped back and tried to smile. &#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; she said.<br> I showed them the cans. &#x201c;Know what this means?&#x201d;<br> I asked.<br> The girl looked worried. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t tell,&#x201d; she said.<br> &#x201c;My parents will kill me if I get detention.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We can pay you!&#x201d; the boy blurted out.<br> &#x201c;How much?&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;Um . . .&#x201d; The boy looked at the girl.<br> &#x201c;Twenty-five cents,&#x201d; the girl offered.<br> &#x201c;Fifty,&#x201d; I said.<br> They looked at each other again.<br> &#x201c;Fifty cents to save our butts from detention?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;How do we know you won&#x2019;t tell?&#x201d; the girl asked.<br> &#x201c;Because I would have already told if I didn&#x2019;t think there was something I could get out of it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Fair enough,&#x201d; the girl said. &#x201c;Here you go.&#x201d; She shook my hand and gave me a dollar. &#x201c;For me and my friend.&#x201d;<br> I took the money and threw the cans into the recycling bin. I wrote in my spiral the date I collected the tax, the reason for collecting it, and how much I got for it. After that, I started watching for litterbugs. Most kids wanted to avoid detention, so to them, fifty cents was an even trade for my silence.<br> Recently, business has really dropped off. Hardly any kids leave trash behind now. Principal Jenkins thinks his policy is what turned the school around. The threat of detention was one reason. Paying my tax to avoid getting caught was a bigger one.<br> I do some stuff for free, too. (Cuz, you know, I&#x2019;m not a monster.) I carry equipment to school rallies and assemblies, I move desks for teachers, and I help out the maintenance staff with stuff like moving bleachers or rolling out the big garbage bins on trash day. I like the maintenance people. They treat me like a normal kid just helping out.<br> But I guess I&#x2019;m not a normal kid. I was born eleven pounds, twenty-six inches. Doesn&#x2019;t seem big until you consider that most babies are more like seven or eight pounds and nineteen or twenty inches when they&#x2019;re born. You get the idea. I was a big infant. Ninety-seventh-percentile big.<br> While most kids just stare, the only kid who never misses a chance to tell me I&#x2019;m not normal is Stephen Hobert.<br> Stephen pronounces his name like he&#x2019;s French, but his family is from Springfield and I know for a fact he&#x2019;s never been to France. His mom is the head of the parents&#x2019; association. She doesn&#x2019;t like students who stand out for &#x201c;all the wrong reasons.&#x201d;<br> Stephen has a crew. I&#x2019;ve seen them pick on kids. Sixth graders are especially afraid of him (in a different way than they are afraid of me). They don&#x2019;t want to get on his bad side.<br> He draws pictures of people he doesn&#x2019;t like and sneaks them into their backpacks and lockers. I caught him once putting one of his masterpieces inside a girl&#x2019;s backpack. At lunch later that day the girl was crying with her friends as she showed them the drawing. I happened to see it as I walked to a lunch table. Stephen drew her like a stick figure with a big round head, bulging eyes, short hair, and a tie. Above the drawing, he wrote, &#x201c;Is it a boy or a girl?&#x201d;<br> Stephen uses words like someone throwing punches.<br> Only it&#x2019;s nearly impossible to find the bruises. He&#x2019;s never been caught.<br> I don&#x2019;t collect garbage tax or cell phone storage fees from Stephen. I&#x2019;ve thought long and hard about it. Sure, he had made a monster out of me by spreading rumors and just being his terrible self. But in a way, he&#x2019;s responsible for my biggest source of income&#x2014;keeping kids away from him.</p><h2>Learning to Share (Peppa Pig)</h2><p>George has a toy dinosaur, and so does Richard Rabbit!

She lives in New York City.PreS-A diaper being thrown into the trash kicks off this upbeat celebration of panties. A pigtailed protagonist skips across the pages. She proclaims the myriad choices that come with being a big girl, from the pictured days of the week set to a pair of frilly pink "Princess panties that sparkle and shine." The bright illustrations, set against a slate blue background, convey the youngster's excitement with a flurry of movement and many proud smiles. She takes a break from dancing and play to inform a baby sibling and a stuffed crocodile that they cannot wear panties, though mommies and grandmas can. At the close of the book the child addresses the listener, who presumably is also in on the fun and thus "a big girl, too!"

You simply dial-in your observing time and date to find the set of constellations visible in your sky (this is accomplished by turning the clear top piece). Although this chart is designed for beginners, seasoned amateur astronomers will find it useful, too. <br><p> This chart can be used anywhere in the world between latitudes 30 and 60 degrees North, which includes the US and Canada, England, Europe, Northern China and Japan. <br></p><p> The 16-inch diameter is large and easy to read, ideal for families, teachers and seniors! The 5th edition has been improved by indicating more binocular objects and providing more pertinent information on the back, all without increasing clutter or decreasing the text size. <br></p><p> The front chart indicates 70 Constellations, the Names of 55 Stars, the Milky Way Band, the Ecliptic (which is the path of the Sun, Moon and Planets), 54 favorite Double Stars, the Summer Triangle, Winter/Summer Tours and 56 Galaxies, Star Clusters and Nebulae that can be observed with binoculars or a small telescope. Additionally, favorite star patterns are noted, like the Great Square of Pegasus, the Circlet of Pisces, the Northern Cross of Cygnus and others. <br></p><p> On the back side, there are useful tables and other astronomical information, including: Mythology, Yearly Meteor Showers, Moon map, Phases of the Moon, Facts about the Planets, A Short history of Astronomy, the 10 Brightest Stars, Information about the Binocular &amp; Telescope Objects (those on the chart), Why Stars Twinkle, additional instructions for using the chart and more. <br></p><p> PLANET NOTE. Most star charts, like this one, do not indicate, on the chart, the position of the Planets or Moon because these objects move through the constellations of the zodiac, along a path in the sky called the Ecliptic (indicated on the chart). Website support is provided to help identify the planets that are visible in the sky. <br></p><p> This chart is also available in a smaller 11-inch diameter (ISBN 1928771-033).

After all, we all need the occasional reminder that peeing in the shower is wrong.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i> - Booklist (Starred Review)</i></b><br><br>"Amen! - a parenting book for crummy parents like me. It's not so much a parenting book, per se - no, it really is an etiquette book. But the tone and language used is straightforward and speaks to teens and young adults in a manner that they understand. And all that stuff you learned in parenting class? It's back, and much more applicable than you thought. . . . The book is rated for 18+, but honest to God, I'll let my 12-year-old daughter read it. There's nothing inappropriate in terms of language or subject matter, I think, for middle schoolers, and frankly, that's where the seeds of dickishness are usually planted."<b><i> - Chicago Now</i></b></p><h2>Happy Birthday to You!

(Stepping Stone Bks.). CIP. Random. 1988. PLB $5.99; pap. $1.95. Grade 2-4-- In the first book, three self-appointed private investigators decide to search their small town for criminals. Julian, his younger brother, and their friend Gloria read the wanted posters in the post office and then set out to investigate the hospital, the local bar, the supermarket, and a restaurant. At the supermarket they convince a man that he should rescue his dog from a hot car, and at the hospital they save a young child from drowning. Considering the length of the book, the plot is well developed and interesting, and the characters are aptly drawn. A quick and interesting read--and one that will surely draw in less-able readers. Aliens for Breakfast is a science fantasy story. Richard meets an alien when he eats a sample box of new breakfast cereal. Together they strive to find the secret weapon which will destroy the enemy alien (who is in Richard's class as the new boy). If not stopped in time, the enemy alien will clone himself and overtake the earth. The drawings are sketchy but adequate to set the mood of the events in a helter-skelter manner. The plot is simple but satisfying. It will be enjoyed by older readers who need simple fare but want something a little out of the ordinary. In Pioneer Cat, nine-year-old Kate Purdy and her family find themselves moving West on the Oregon Trail. The characters ward off a buffalo stampede and an Indian attack and deal with a stowaway cat and her surprise kittens, all the while chronicling the trip itself and the developing friendship between Kate and Rosie Murphy. Robinson's black-and-white illustrations are just detailed enough to add some depth to the text but not so overwhelming as to give a "too young" look to the book. The print is easy to read but not oversized (a factor that often turns away older reluctant readers). While the brevity does not allow for substantial character or plot development, Hooks does give the essence of Kate's sensitive and cunning nature while portraying Rosie as a self-sufficient young girl and a faithful friend. The fast-moving plot helps readers along. --Sharron McElmeel, Cedar Rapids Community Schools, Iowa<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Our Q&amp;A a Day: 3-Year Journal for 2 People</h2><p><b>With this one-sentence journal, couples can create a three-year time capsule of their relationship in the easiest way possible. </b><br><br><i>Our Q&amp;A a Day</i> provides a question for every day of the year, with enough space for two people to jot down a one- or two-sentence response.

In West: The American Cowboy, Anouk revisits this enduring iconic symbol of America's pioneering spirit. Set out in a stunning large-format book, and with heartfelt contributions from Jon Pardi, Red Steagall and others, the pages within inspire with a fresh and contemporary perspective of the American West. Along with the cowboy's ranching traditions comes a life built around the core values and faith that are central to their integrity. Long admired for their strength, relentless work ethic, and humble values, the forgotten American cowboy is alive and well, and has never stood in such stark contrast to the rapidly changing nation that surrounds them.<br> <br><br>Earning wide acclaim for her incredible fine art work exhibited in galleries and published in the bestselling Wild Horses of Cumberland Island (2017), also by IMAGES, West: The American Cowboy is another artful, intimate study of the American character and their sense of place, and is a unique collection of works brought together by this award-winning photographer and storyteller.</p><p>Born and raised in France, Anouk Masson Krantz moved to the United States in the late 1990s. Living in New York, she completed her high school at the Lyc�e Fran�ais and earned her bachelor degree while working for a lifestyle magazine. Following college she worked at Cartier's corporate office in New York that oversees the Americas. Anouk later studied at the International Center of Photography and has developed several notable bodies of work, including Wild Horses of Cumberland Island. Her work has appeared in prominent galleries and earned accolades from the International Photography Awards and International Monochrome Awards. Her first book <em>Wild Horses of Cumberland Island</em> (2017) became an immediate bestseller among the photography genre. The book and her art have been praised by international publications, such as Vanity Fair, Town &amp; Country, Time, Harper s Bazaar, Daily Mail UK, and Garden &amp; Gun among many others.John Wayne was always one to grab the bulls by the horns. As do the wranglers photographed in West: The American Cowboy, the forthcoming new book that reframes contemporary ranch culture. The book's black and white portraits, which range from rodeos and wranglers to open skies and dramatic flatlands, have a cinematic quality that evokes a lodestar of American life: the Wild West. One can't help but imagine how intrepid auteur Anouk Masson Krantz might have photographed Duke in his day, being as he was, most home on the range (and obviously comfortable with the camera): with hat, horse and bandana to boot.

Shel Silverstein has created a moving parable for readers of all ages that offers an affecting interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another's capacity to love in return.</p><p>And don't miss <em>Runny Babbit Returns</em>, the new book from Shel Silverstein!</p></p><p>To say that this particular apple tree is a "giving tree" is an understatement. In Shel Silverstein's popular tale of few words and simple line drawings, a tree starts out as a leafy playground, shade provider, and apple bearer for a rambunctious little boy. Making the boy happy makes the tree happy, but with time it becomes more challenging for the generous tree to meet his needs. When he asks for money, she suggests that he sell her apples. When he asks for a house, she offers her branches for lumber. When the boy is old, too old and sad to play in the tree, he asks the tree for a boat. She suggests that he cut her down to a stump so he can craft a boat out of her trunk. He unthinkingly does it. At this point in the story, the double-page spread shows a pathetic solitary stump, poignantly cut down to the heart the boy once carved into the tree as a child that said "M.E. + T." "And then the tree was happy... but not really." When there's nothing left of her, the boy returns again as an old man, needing a quiet place to sit and rest. The stump offers up her services, and he sits on it. "And the tree was happy." While the message of this book is unclear (Take and take and take? Give and give and give? Complete self-sacrifice is good? Complete self-sacrifice is infinitely sad?), Silverstein has perhaps deliberately left the book open to interpretation.

Bikers, con artists, drunk drivers, drug dealers -- they're all on Mickey Haller's client list. For him, the law is rarely about guilt or innocence, it's about negotiation and manipulation. Sometimes it's even about justice.<br><br>A Beverly Hills playboy arrested for attacking a woman he picked up in a bar chooses Haller to defend him, and Mickey has his first high-paying client in years. It is a defense attorney's dream, what they call a franchise case. And as the evidence stacks up, Haller comes to believe this may be the easiest case of his career. Then someone close to him is murdered and Haller discovers that his search for innocence has brought him face-to-face with evil as pure as a flame. To escape without being burned, he must deploy every tactic, feint, and instinct in his arsenal -- this time to save his own life.<br>This #1 bestselling legal thriller from Michael Connelly is a stunning display of novelistic mastery -- as human, as gripping, and as whiplash-surprising as any novel yet from the writer <em>Publishers Weekly</em> has called "today's Dostoevsky of crime literature."</p><p>Best-selling author Michael Connelly, whose character-driven literary mysteries have earned him a wide following, breaks from the gate in the over-crowded field of legal thrillers and leaves every other contender from Grisham to Turow in the dust with this tightly plotted, brilliantly paced, impossible-to-put-down novel. <p> Criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller's father was a legendary lawyer whose clients included gangster Mickey Cohen (in a nice twist, Cohen's gun, given to Dad then bequeathed to his son, plays a key role in the plot). But Dad also passed on an important piece of advice that's especially relevant when Mickey takes the case of a wealthy Los Angeles realtor accused of attempted murder: "The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client. Because if you [screw] up and he goes to prison, it'll scar you for life." </p><p> Louis Roulet, Mickey's "franchise client" (so-called becaue he's able and willing to pay whatever his defense costs) seems to be the one his father warned him against, as well as being a few rungs higher on the socio-economic ladder than the drug dealers, homeboys, and motorcycle thugs who comprise Mickey's regular case load. But as the holes in Roulet's story tear Mickey's theory of the case to shreds, his thoughts turn more to Jesus Menendez, a former client convicted of a similar crime who's now languishing in San Quentin. Connelly tellingly delineates the code of legal ethics Mickey lives by: "It didn't matter...whether the defendant 'did it' or not. What mattered was the evidence against him--the proof--and if and how it could be neutralized. My job was to bury the proof, to color the proof a shade of gray. Gray was the color of reasonable doubt." But by the time his client goes to trial, Mickey's feeling a few very reasonable doubts of his own. </p><p> While Mickey's courtroom pyrotechnics dazzle, his behind-the-scenes machinations and manipulations are even more incendiary in this taut, gripping novel, which showcases all of Connelly's literary gifts. There's not an excess sentence or padded paragraph in it--what there is, happily, is a character who, like Harry Bosch, deserves a franchise series of his own. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Michael Connelly (born July 21, 1956, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American author of detective novels, notably those featuring Detective Hieronymus &#34;Harry&#34; Bosch. Bosch, named after the Dutch painter of the same name, is the protagonist of a series of Connelly&#39;s novels. The character is an LAPD detective. The Black Echo, the first book featuring Bosch, won the Mystery Writers of America&#39;s Edgar Award for Best First Novel of 1992. Connelly has written other books outside the Bosch series, including Blood Work, which was made into a 2002 movie directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. In 2006, The Lincoln Lawyer was selected as one of ten books to feature in Richard and Judy&#39;s televised book club. Connelly is a graduate of the University of Florida, where he earned a bachelors degree in journalism. In addition to his books, Connelly has written for television.</p><h2>The Coffee Recipe Book: 50 Coffee and Espresso Drinks to Make at Home</h2><p><p><strong>The simple art and tradition of brewing the perfect cup&#x2015;at home.</strong></p><p>Whether it&#x2019;s a morning drip or an evening espresso martini, amazing coffee is an artform. <em>The Coffee Recipe Book</em> is your guide to understanding how everything comes together for an artisanal coffee drink.</p><p>With 50 different recipes ranging from classic cappuccino to specialty lattes, there&#x2019;s a delicious option for everyone.

Django&#x2019;s first book, an epic fantasy novel for adults, was published by Roc in Summer 2013.&nbsp;<i>The Forbidden Library</i>&nbsp;is his first novel for children.<p><b>Chapter One:&nbsp;The Fairy</b></p><p>Much later, Alice would wonder what might have happened if she&#x2019;d gone to bed when she was supposed to.</p><p>It was a fluke, really, because she was the sort of girl who almost always followed the rules. But she&#x2019;d been doing schoolwork and she&#x2019;d lost track of time.</p><p>It was a Saturday night, and her tutor, Miss Juniper, had assigned her another chunk of algebra for Monday morning. Alice excelled in all her subjects&#x2014;she never would have allowed it to be otherwise&#x2014;but in algebra her excellence was born of hard work and long hours rather than natural talent, so she&#x2019;d determined to make an early start. She wouldn&#x2019;t be bothering anyone, either. Her room had its own little writing desk and even its own electric lamp, which her father had had installed three years before with the boast that no daughter of <i>his</i> was going to ruin her eyes scribbling by gaslight.</p><p>Her father had been working late again. When Alice heard the telltale creak of the front door, she weighed the odds and decided he&#x2019;d probably be happier to see her than angry that she was still up. She shrugged into her robe and padded into the hall and down the stairs.</p><p>The late-night silence was a little unnerving. Alice had grown up in a house that had practically bustled with servants and guests, even in the middle of the night, and she was used to seeing strangers about. But the servants had departed one by one as times had grown mean, until only Cook, Miss Juniper, and her father&#x2019;s man were left, and the visitors were less common than they used to be. The guest rooms that lined the hallway were all shut up now, with sheets draped over the furniture.</p><p>She passed the doors quickly, tugging her robe a little tighter, and ducked into the servants&#x2019; stairs that led to the kitchen. Her father would probably be there, fixing himself something hot to drink.</p><p>Sure enough, the swinging door at the bottom of the steps was outlined in yellow light. Alice put her hand out to push it open, but as her fingers brushed the wood she heard the voices, and realized her father wasn&#x2019;t alone.</p><p>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you have to know what we can do for you, Mr. Creighton,&#x201d; said someone who wasn&#x2019;t her father. &#x201c;Someone is going to take advantage of it sooner or later.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice turned away at once. Being up late was one thing, but eavesdropping on her father&#x2019;s business conversations was quite another. She&#x2019;d put her foot on the first step when the sound of her father&#x2019;s voice brought her up short.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you <i>dare</i> threaten my family.&#x201d;</p><p>The words hung in the air for long seconds, like a fading firework.</p><p>Her father never shouted, at least not in her hearing. He was a quiet, honest man who dealt fairly with everyone, put flowers on her mother&#x2019;s grave once a month, and went to church every Sunday. Hearing him talk like that was like watching a teddy bear yawn and reveal a mouth full of fangs. Alice stood perfectly still, not daring to move even her eyes. She wanted to run, knew she <i>ought</i> to&#x2014;whatever was being said was obviously not for her ears&#x2014;but her feet felt like lead weights.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Creighton,&#x201d; said the other man. &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s <i>threatening</i>. I&#x2019;m just stating a fact. Nothing wrong with stating a fact, is there? No law against it.&#x201d;</p><p>His voice was odd, high and nasal. Alice could hear a strange sound as well, a kind of urgent <i>thrum-thrum-thrum</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mess me around,&#x201d; her father said, not shouting now but still angrier than she&#x2019;d ever heard him. &#x201c;We both know what you&#x2019;re here to say, and I&#x2019;m sure you know what my answer&#x2019;s going to be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I strongly recommend you reconsider your position, Mr. Creighton.&#x201d; The thrumming grew louder. &#x201c;For the sake of everyone involved.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By God,&#x201d; Alice&#x2019;s father said. &#x201c;So help me, I ought to break your ugly head against the wall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could do that,&#x201d; the other man said. &#x201c;You could do that, Mr. Creighton. But you won&#x2019;t. You know it would be unwise.&#x201d; His voice dropped a fraction. &#x201c;For the girl, most of all.&#x201d;</p><p>Slowly, ever so slowly, Alice turned around. Her heart was still beating so hard, it seemed a wonder that her father couldn&#x2019;t hear it. She stepped back down to the door, carefully avoiding the creaky step, and pressed her fingers into the crack of light. It was wrong, possibly the most wrong thing she had ever done in her entire <i>life,</i> but she had to see. She gave the swinging door the lightest touch, and the crack widened into a gap big enough for a garter snake, to which she applied her eye.</p><p>The light made her squint. On one side of the room was her father, still in his suit, looking rumpled. His hair was damp with sweat. One of his hands was curled around the handle of a cast-iron frying pan sitting on the range, as though he meant to swing it and make good on his threat.</p><p>Across from him, hanging in the air, was a fairy.</p><p>When Alice had been a little girl, her father had given her a book called <i>The Enchanted Forest</i>. It was a big book made with thick paper, and had large type with pen-and-ink illustrations on each facing page. She&#x2019;d probably been a bit too old for it, truth be told, but she&#x2019;d read it anyway, as she read every piece of printed material that fell within her reach. It was the story of a rather stupid little girl who wandered into an enchanted forest, and caused a good deal of havoc among the creatures who lived there.</p><p>One of those creatures had been a fairy. It was a slim, child-like figure with wide eyes and a button nose wearing flowing robes, held aloft by gauzy insect wings&#x2014;Alice had always imagined the wings in translucent greens and blues, like a butterfly&#x2019;s&#x2014;and it had looked down at the little girl with an air of amused benevolence while it stood daintily in her raised palm.</p><p>At that age, Alice had grasped the idea that some things in books were real, and others were not. Questioning her father had revealed that there were such things as lions, tigers, and elephants (he&#x2019;d promised a visit to the zoo, which had yet to happen), while trolls, centaurs, and dragons were the figments of writers&#x2019; overactive imaginations. Alice remembered feeling vaguely annoyed at the author of <i>The Enchanted Forest,</i> who had clearly intended to deceive little girls possessing less penetrating intellects than her own.</p><p>There was, her father had told her, no such thing as fairies, either.</p><p>The thing hovering in the air in Alice&#x2019;s kitchen was similar enough to the picture in the book to be instantly recognizable, but he was larger, for one thing. The creature in the book had been insectile, six inches high at most, while this creature was a good two feet from head to heel. His wings were enormous, considerably bigger than his slender body, and beat the air so fast, they were a blur, like a hummingbird&#x2019;s. They were colored, not in greens and blues, but yellow and black, which put Alice in mind of something nasty and poisonous.</p><p>The fairy&#x2019;s skin was off-white and gnarled with warty growths sprouting clusters of thick, black hair. His scalp was bare and bald as an egg, gleaming wetly in the electric light. He had no nose at all, and his eyes were wide but black from edge to edge. When he spoke, she could see a mouth full of needle-like teeth, and a long red tongue like a snake&#x2019;s.</p><p>Alice closed her eyes. <i>This</i>, she thought, <i>is ridiculous</i>. <i>There are no such things as fairies.</i> She gave herself a pinch on the arm, which hurt, and counted slowly to ten.</p><p><i>When I open my eyes, </i>she thought, <i>he will be gone</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;I really wish you&#x2019;d at least hear my offer,&#x201d; said the nasal voice.</p><p>Alice opened her eyes. The fairy was still there. He had hovered closer to her father, his wings <i>thrum-thrumming,</i> one tiny finger wagging in under his nose.</p><p>&#x201c;I will not,&#x201d; Alice&#x2019;s father said. &#x201c;I will not entertain any sort of <i>offer</i>. Go back and tell your master that. And tell him, if he troubles me again, I&#x2019;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>The fairy waited, lip curled in a cocky grin that showed his teeth. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll what, Mr. Creighton?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get out!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Get out of my house!&#x201d;</p><p>There was a long moment of silence. The fairy hovered, impudently, as if to demonstrate that he didn&#x2019;t <i>have</i> to go just because her father had said so. Then, with an affected sigh, he spun in the air and zipped out the open doorway on the other side of the room. Alice heard one of the front windows rattle open.</p><p>Her father sagged, like a heavy weight had been fastened around his shoulders. He let go of the frying pan and leaned on the range for support. Alice wanted to run to him, but she didn&#x2019;t dare. Whatever she had just seen&#x2014;and she was still not certain <i>what</i> she had just seen&#x2014;it was something she had not been supposed to witness.</p><p>Alice&#x2019;s father took a long breath, closed his eyes, and blew it out slowly, tickling the edges of his mustache. Then his eyes snapped open, full of panic.</p><p>&#x201c;Alice,&#x201d; he said, under his breath. &#x201c;Oh God.&#x201d;</p><p>All of a sudden he was running, struggling to get his feet under him, caroming off the kitchen doorway and out toward the main stairs. Alice was caught for a moment in stunned surprise, then started running herself, back up the servants&#x2019; stairs, heedless of the creaking. He made it to her door only a few seconds before she arrived.</p><p>Finding the door ajar, he flung it open, and stared wide-eyed at the empty room. His expression, bathed in the glow of her electric desk lamp, was the most terrifying thing Alice had ever seen.</p><p>She hurried to his side and grabbed his arm. &#x201c;Father! Is something wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2014;&#x201d; He gestured weakly at her empty room, then down at her. &#x201c;I thought&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was studying,&#x201d; Alice said, &#x201c;and I got up for a moment. I&#x2019;m sorry if I startled you.&#x201d;</p><p>All at once his fierceness melted, and he wrapped his arms around her in a hug so tight, he lifted her off the ground.</p><p>&#x201c;Alice,&#x201d; he said, his scratchy cheek pressed against her forehead. &#x201c;Alice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here, Father.&#x201d; She squirmed until she worked her own arms free, then put them around him as far as they would go.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; he said. She wasn&#x2019;t sure if he was talking to himself or not. &#x201c;Everything is going to be all right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course it is,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>When he let go, there was something new in his face, a strange, wild determination so far out of the ordinary that it made Alice feel scared and proud of him, both at once. He set her down gently, put his hands on her shoulders, and looked her in the eye.</p><p>&#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You know that, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Alice felt herself blushing. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes were already miles away. He patted her shoulder, absently, and then hurried toward his study. Alice looked after him, wondering about the decision she&#x2019;d seen in his eyes.</p><p>Then, because she was a girl who followed the rules, she went back into her room and went to bed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next morning, everything seemed so normal that Alice almost thought she&#x2019;d dreamed the whole thing. Almost, but not quite.</p><p>She woke up in her familiar bed, under her warm, familiar quilt with its frayed edge. Her room was just her familiar room, with the heavy oak wardrobe in one corner and the framed picture of her grandmother looking down benevolently.</p><p>There was no elf sitting on her desk, and her books were just where she&#x2019;d left them the night before. No troll in the heavy wooden chest at the foot of the bed, only the winter comforters and an ancient pair of stuffed rabbits she couldn&#x2019;t quite bear to throw away. She even, feeling intensely self-conscious, lifted the bedskirts and looked underneath, but there was no dragon there, only a thick layer of dust.</p><p>Nevertheless, she was certain what she&#x2019;d seen had been real. The memory was bright and clear, not fuzzy and fading the way dreams were. When she sat down for breakfast with her father, she became doubly sure. He was acting normal, but it <i>was</i> an act, a little too sincere to believe.</p><p>&#x201c;Earthquakes again,&#x201d; he said, paging through the <i>Times</i>. &#x201c;First New Zealand, now Managua. Thousands dead, it says.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s terrible,&#x201d; Alice said, because she knew it was expected of her. She was trying to keep from staring at her father&#x2019;s face. He&#x2019;d washed and shaved since last night, of course, but there was still something tight around his eyes. <i>It wasn&#x2019;t a dream,</i> she thought. <i>I&#x2019;m sure of it.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Something ought to be done about it,&#x201d; he said, turning the page. &#x201c;And still fighting in Spain. Seems like the whole world&#x2019;s coming to pieces.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You always say they only print the bad news,&#x201d; Alice said.</p><p>Her father looked up and smiled, but it didn&#x2019;t reach his eyes.</p><p>Cooper, her father&#x2019;s man, appeared with a plate of toast and jam. Properly speaking, it wasn&#x2019;t his job to serve at table, but Alice&#x2019;s father had been forced to give the last of the footmen the sack when they&#x2019;d caught him stealing from the pantry. Cooper insisted he didn&#x2019;t mind. In this day and age, he said, a man ought to be grateful to have work at all.</p><p>Her father put the paper aside and went to work on the toast, all in silence. Alice took a slice herself and carefully covered it with jam, right to the edges, working carefully with the butter knife to spread it evenly. The longer neither of them spoke, the more the silence grew and grew, like some monstrous thing squatting on the table between them. When her father finally cleared his throat Alice gave a little start.</p><p>&#x201c;Alice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Father?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going on a trip.&#x201d; He paused, and took a deep breath. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s come up. It&#x2019;s important, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When?&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;And how long will you be gone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m catching a steamer tonight.&#x201d;</p><p><i>A ship?</i> Her father&#x2019;s business took him all over New England, and occasionally as far as Chicago or Washington, D.C., but he&#x2019;d never been gone for more than a week, and never on a steamer. &#x201c;And where&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; He folded the paper and pushed it over to her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the <i>Gideon,</i> bound for Buenos Aires.&#x201d; The schedule, a set of stops all down through the Caribbean and South America, was printed in a neat box beside the ticket prices and number for inquiries. &#x201c;This way you&#x2019;ll be able to keep track of me.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice put one hand on the paper and swallowed hard, trying to sound as normal as she could. &#x201c;When should I expect you back?&#x201d;</p><p>His expression cracked. Just for a moment, but Alice was watching him closely, and she knew him better than anyone. His mouth turned down, pulling at his mustache, and his eyes glittered with tears.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be some time,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Alice. I wish there was another way.&#x201d;</p><p>Something was wrong, very wrong. Alice fought a growing thickness in her throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps I should come with you,&#x201d; she said. Ordinarily she wouldn&#x2019;t have dreamed of offering such a suggestion unbidden, but desperate times called for desperate measures. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve always said I need more experience in the practical side of business&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, a little too quickly. &#x201c;Not this trip. When I get back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He forced a smile. &#x201c;Maybe then it&#x2019;ll be time for you to start making the rounds with me.

With stunning art by acclaimed illustrator Bryan Collier, <i>Martin's Big Words</i> is an unforgettable portrait of a man whose dream changed America-and the world-forever.</p><p>In this elegant pictorial biography of Martin Luther King Jr., author Doreen Rappaport combines her spare, lyrical text with King's own words for an effective, age-appropriate portrayal of one of the world's greatest civil rights leaders. From King's youth, when he looked up to his preacher father and vowed one day to "get big words, too," to his death at a garbage workers' strike ("On his second day there, he was shot. He died."), Rappaport imbues the story with reverence.<p> Acclaimed artist Bryan Collier depicts his subject with stunning watercolor and collage illustrations, balancing glorious recreations of stained glass windows with some of the more somber images of peace marchers and the famous bus that pitched Rosa Parks into the civil rights movement. A brief chronology and bibliography provide additional resources for readers. Here is an exquisite tribute to a world hero.

His father, Clarence, was musical and played the violin. His mother, Dorothy, was a writer and a high school Latin and journalism instructor. After living in Seattle and Florida, the family moved to Portland, Oregon, where Jim began his piano studies with Frances Mulkey North. Subsequently, Jim studied with the late Ariel Rubstein, the late Louis Artau, and the late Gyorgy Sandor.<br><br>Jim received his undergraduate and masters degrees from Southern Methodist University. He was a former member of the faculties of Notre Dame University, Tulane University, Loyola University (New Orleans), and the summer faculties of Tanglewood and the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan.<br><br>Jim met his wife Jane Smisor in New Orleans in 1960. They performed as the duo-piano team, Smisor and Bastien. In addition, Jim was a Columbia Artist accompanist whose collaborative career included appearances with Richard Tucker and John Alexander. During this time Jim and Jane started writing music to address the needs of their students. This was the beginning of the Bastien piano books that have inspired so many piano students and teachers.<br><br>The Bastien piano books have been published worldwide by the Neil A. Kjos Music Company since 1963 and are now translated into 14 languages. In 1999, The Music Teachers National Association presented Jim and Jane with the Lifetime Achievement Award, the association's highest honor, in recognition of their outstanding career in music and contribution to the music profession.<br><br>James W. Bastien, loving husband and father, and a passionate piano pedagogue and musician, passed away on December 7, 2005, in La Jolla, California. During his long career, Jim became internationally known through his contributions to piano teaching, composing, writing, adjudication, and performing. With more than 300 publications to his credit, the Bastien name has become synonymous with innovative piano pedagogy.</p><h2>Disney Pixar Toy Story 4 Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Bo Peep, and More! - Look and Find Activity Book - PI Kids</h2><p><p>This Look and Find book contains the amazing new (and familiar favorite!) characters of Disney Pixar's <i>Toy Story 4</i>, now out in theaters!</p><p>Your little one can look for "find'ems" in eight busy scenes.

It will be an affirmation that, no matter how often you may think it, you are never alone. Somewhere up above, there is a universal guidance system, and you are on that radar screen.<br> My own revelation of Godwinks<p></p> <br>The concept that Godwinks can be revisited to create a chronicle of past winks from God first occurred to me as I sorted through the turning points in my own life.<br> <br>I focused on the moment when I first realized what I wanted to be when I grew up. It was in sixth grade. A visit to a radio station had hooked me. I wanted to be a radio announcer.<br> <br>By tenth grade, I had spent four years talking into a broom handle, driving my older brother crazy, reading the newspaper aloud, forcing my voice down low like David Brinkley.<br> <br>But my real hero was a morning personality on a radio station sixty miles south of my little town of Adams Center, New York. Dean Harris was an energetic disc jockey, fond of ordering his legions of listeners to get up and &#x201c;march around the breakfast table&#x201d; to whatever melody he was playing. And into my broom, around our breakfast table at home, I frequently emulated him, causing my brother to send a Wheaties box sailing in my direction.<br> <br>When the Godwink occurred, I was fifteen. It was a very important day. Somehow I had landed an interview with Jim Higgins, the general manager of WCNY-TV, ten miles to the north in Watertown. My mode of transportation: hitchhiking, a relatively safe undertaking in those days.<br> <br>The traffic on that rural road was sparse, and every car passed me by. Fretting that I hadn&#x2019;t left enough time to get to my appointment, I began to lose faith.<br> <br>Then, a green Volkswagen suddenly swerved to the side of the road.<br> <br>The door flung open.<br> <br>A cheerful balding man beckoned me in, asking my destination. I was so grateful for the lift, I anxiously spewed out not only the destination but the purpose of my mission as well.<br> <br>When I came up for air, the driver thrust me a handshake and said, &#x201c;You tell Jim Higgins I said &#x2018;Hello.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>I blinked.<br> <br>&#x201c;By the way,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;my name&#x2019;s Dean Harris.&#x201d;<br> <br>Think of it. Of all the people who could have helped me get to where I was going that day, in any one of the cars that came down that road, the one who stopped to take me to my first and most important interview for a television job was none other than my hero, Dean Harris.<br> <br>For a young hitchhiker with nothing but a dream, that was a clear Godwink to boost my faith, just when I needed it. I wondered then and many times since just how such remarkable events could have occurred. The mathematical odds of such happenings are colossal. In retrospect, the message of that uplifting experience was that such fortuitous events are not random. Instead they are clear signposts on the path of life, revealing that each of us is guided by a powerful force toward our destiny.<br> <br>That Godwink, at the genesis of my career, was indeed a small though powerful communication, telling me to keep my faith, to stay on my chosen course, and that everything would turn out just fine.<br> <br>Oh yes, I got the job.<br> What you can learn from my story<p></p> <br>I hope this story will trigger your memory, helping you to start digging into forgotten Godwinks of your own personal history. To begin, think about the major crossroads in your life that are related to your own career.<br> <br>Dim the lights, grab a decent pen, get in a comfortable chair, and let your mind wander back to some of your earliest memories. Write the answers to the questions that follow in a wink diary, which I&#x2019;ll tell you about in the next section. Let the pen flow without editing yourself as you write. You will be surprised at the forgotten turning points that will emerge.<br> <br>� What is your first memory of what you wanted to be when you grew up?<br> <br>� Can you recall how old you were? Where you were? Who was with you?<br> <br>� Was there some event, some place, or some person that ignited your career or life interest?<br> <br>� How did you go about making that first step related to your eventual career or life interest?<br> <br>� Finally, can you recall a Godwink&#x2014;any unusual experience or happenstance&#x2014;relating to your career or life interest?<br> <br>The last question is the hardest to answer. Don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;you&#x2019;re not alone. Godwinks are dismissed, repressed, and overlooked by everyone. As such, they are not easily uncovered. You need patience. And persistence. But before long, digging up Godwinks of the past will become easier, and you&#x2019;ll think you&#x2019;re mining gold out of your very own life. Before you know it, you will have learned to recognize the significance of Godwinks as they happen rather than years later.<br> <br>You may have interpreted what you thought was a &#x201c;coincidence&#x201d; relating to your career as some silly little occurrence that happened to you once&#x2014;nothing more significant. That&#x2019;s what happened to me; I had always recalled being picked up by my hero while hitchhiking to my first job, but it never dawned on me&#x2014;until I began writing this book&#x2014;that it was actually a remarkable sign of encouragement that I was on the right path.<br> <br>Later on, I will show you that your dreams, wishes, and prayers can actually help you cultivate Godwinks and use them to enrich your life. By focusing on a desired outcome, you can cause Godwinks to appear all along your path.<br> A diary of winks<p></p> <br>I keep a thin, narrow diary that slips nicely into an inside coat pocket or a briefcase. It&#x2019;s my diary of winks. Whenever a Godwink occurs, I jot it down. Or whenever there&#x2019;s a turning-point event that I assume will trigger a Godwink, I also write it down, leaving space to register the wink when it happens. More often than not, the Godwinks I record in my diary are small, everyday experiences. But while most are not earth-shattering, it has been quite eye-opening to flip back through the pages. After only a few weeks of keeping my diary, I was startled by the prolific nature of Godwinks that I used to shrug away. And I am impressed with the reaffirmation that Godwinks from above occur at every crossroads.<br> <br>Try it.<br> <br>Make an easy-to-use diary&#x2014;perhaps a small notebook like mine, the notes app on your phone, or even a piece of paper stuck to the refrigerator door.<br> <br>The important thing is to keep the diary in sight and not out of mind. The fleeting nature of Godwinks is that they slip into and out of our lives in a blink&#x2014;so you need to get into the habit of jotting them down immediately.<br> My promise to you<p></p> <br>First, you are under the influence of a built-in GPS&#x2014;God&#x2019;s Positioning System&#x2014;and every day you receive little nudges to keep you on your chosen path.<br> <br>Second, tracking the Godwinks in your past will create an astonishingly lucid account of your life, while providing clarity to the grand possibilities on the road ahead.<br> <br>Third, you can learn to harness the power of Godwinks to enrich your future and to strengthen your inner convictions that the life path you&#x2019;ve chosen is indeed God&#x2019;s path for you.<br> <br>Lastly, you&#x2019;ll see that Godwinks happen for a reason, and that&#x2019;s to let you know one thing: You are not alone.<br> <br>In all your ways acknowledge him,<br> <br>and he shall direct your paths.<br> <br>&#x2014;PROVERBS 3:6 KJV</p><h2>Make Way for Dyamonde Daniel (A Dyamonde Daniel Book)</h2><p><b>"Dyamonde, a third grader, has "wild-crazy hair," is "skinnier than half a toothpick" and is more than equal to the challenge of entering the crowded field of confident grade school heroines."&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>Dyamonde Daniel may be new in town, but that doesn't stop her from making a place for herself in a jiffy.

Please, trust me. I most definitely can be cheerful. I can be amiable. Agreeable. Affable. And that's only the A's. Just don't ask me to be nice. Nice has nothing to do with me.<br>***Reaction to the&nbsp; ***<br>AFOREMENTIONED fact<br>Does this worry you?<br>I urge you--don't be afraid.<br>I'm nothing if not fair.<br>--Of course, an introduction.<br>A beginning.<br>Where are my manners?<br>I could introduce myself properly, but it's not really necessary. You will know me well enough and soon enough, depending on a diverse range of variables. It suffices to say that at some point in time, I will be standing over you, as genially as possible. Your soul will be in my arms. A color will be perched on my shoulder. I will carry you gently away.<br>At that moment, you will be lying there (I rarely find people standing up). You will be caked in your own body. There might be a discovery; a scream will dribble down the air. The only sound I'll hear after that will be my own breathing, and the sound of the smell, of my footsteps.<br>The question is, what color will everything be at that moment when I come for you? What will the sky be saying?<br>Personally, I like a chocolate-colored sky. Dark, dark chocolate. People say it suits me. I do, however, try to enjoy every color I see--the whole spectrum. A billion or so flavors, none of them quite the same, and a sky to slowly suck on. It takes the edge off the stress. It helps me relax.<br>***A SMALL THEORY&nbsp; ***<br>People observe the colors of a day only at its beginnings and ends, but to me it's quite clear that a day merges through a multitude of shades and intonations, with each passing moment. <br>A single hour can consist of thousands of different colors. <br>Waxy yellows, cloud-spat blues. Murky darknesses. <br>In my line of work, I make it a point to notice them.<br>As I've been alluding to, my one saving grace is distraction. It keeps me sane. It helps me cope, considering the length of time I've been performing this job. The trouble is, who could ever replace me? Who could step in while I take a break in your stock-standard resort-style vacation destination, whether it be tropical or of the ski trip variety? The answer, of course, is nobody, which has prompted me to make a conscious, deliberate decision--to make distraction my vacation. Needless to say, I vacation in increments. In colors.<br>Still, it's possible that you might be asking, why does he even need a vacation? What does he need distraction from?<br>Which brings me to my next point.<br>It's the leftover humans.<br>The survivors.<br>They're the ones I can't stand to look at, although on many occasions I still fail. I deliberately seek out the colors to keep my mind off them, but now and then, I witness the ones who are left behind, crumbling among the jigsaw puzzle of realization, despair, and surprise. They have punctured hearts. They have beaten lungs.<br>Which in turn brings me to the subject I am telling you about tonight, or today, or whatever the hour and color. It's the story of one of those perpetual survivors--an expert at being left behind.<br>It's just a small story really, about, among other things:<br>* A girl<br>* Some words<br>* An accordionist<br>* Some fanatical Germans<br>* A Jewish fist fighter<br>* And quite a lot of thievery<br>I saw the book thief three times.<br>BESIDE THE RAILWAY LINE<br>First up is something white. Of the blinding kind.<br>Some of you are most likely thinking that white is not really a color and all of that tired sort of nonsense. Well, I'm here to tell you that it is. White is without question a color, and personally, I don't think you want to argue with me.<br>***A REASSURING ANNOUNCEMENT&nbsp; ***<br>Please, be calm, despite that previous threat.<br>I am all bluster--<br>I am not violent. <br>I am not malicious.<br>I am a result.<br>Yes, it was white.<br>It felt as though the whole globe was dressed in snow. Like it had pulled it on, the way you pull on a sweater. Next to the train line, footprints were sunken to their shins. Trees wore blankets of ice.<br>As you might expect, someone had died.<br>They couldn't just leave him on the ground. For now, it wasn't such a problem, but very soon, the track ahead would be cleared and the train would need to move on.<br>There were two guards.<br>There was one mother and her daughter.<br>One corpse.<br>The mother, the girl, and the corpse remained stubborn and silent.<br>"Well, what else do you want me to do?"<br>The guards were tall and short. The tall one always spoke first, though he was not in charge. He looked at the smaller, rounder one. The one with the juicy red face.<br>"Well," was the response, "we can't just leave them like this, can we?"<br>The tall one was losing patience. "Why not?"<br>And the smaller one damn near exploded. He looked up at the tall one's chin and cried, "Spinnst du! Are you stupid?!" The abhorrence on his cheeks was growing thicker by the moment. His skin widened. "Come on," he said, traipsing over the snow. "We'll carry all three of them back on if we have to. We'll notify the next stop."<br>As for me, I had already made the most elementary of mistakes. I can't explain to you the severity of my self-disappointment. Originally, I'd done everything right:<br>I studied the blinding, white-snow sky who stood at the window of the moving train. I practically inhaled it, but still, I wavered. I buckled--I became interested. In the girl. Curiosity got the better of me, and I resigned myself to stay as long as my schedule allowed, and I watched.<br>Twenty-three minutes later, when the train was stopped, I climbed out with them.<br>A small soul was in my arms.<br>I stood a little to the right.<br>The dynamic train guard duo made their way back to the mother, the girl, and the small male corpse. I clearly remember that my breath was loud that day. I'm surprised the guards didn't notice me as they walked by. The world was sagging now, under the weight of all that snow.<br>Perhaps ten meters to my left, the pale, empty-stomached girl was standing, frost-stricken.<br>Her mouth jittered.<br>Her cold arms were folded.<br>Tears were frozen to the book thief's face.</p><h2>Orange Pear Apple Bear (Classic Board Books)</h2><p>Destined to become a contemporary classic, this book has spare text and sweet illustrations but contains only five words: <i>apple</i>, <i>pear</i>, <i>orange</i>, <i>bear</i>--and <i>there</i>. Emily Gravett creates clever variations on this theme by rearranging the words--on one spread, a brown bear juggles an orange, apple, and pear; on another spread, there is an orange-colored apple and a pear-shaped bear. Simple and compelling, children will enjoy reading this book over and over again as they learn many different concepts.</p><p>Emily Gravett is the author and illustrator of&nbsp;<i>Matilda&#x2019;s Cat</i>,&nbsp;<i>Again!</i>,&nbsp;<i>Wolf Won&#x2019;t Bite!</i>,&nbsp;<i>Blue Chameleon</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Odd Egg</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Rabbit Problem</i>,&nbsp;<i>Dogs</i>,&nbsp;<i>Spells</i>,&nbsp;<i>Little Mouse&#x2019;s Big Book of Fears</i>&nbsp;(winner of the Kate Greenaway Medal),&nbsp;<i>Little Mouse&#x2019;s Big Book of Beasts</i>,&nbsp;<i>Monkey and Me, Meerkat Mail, Tidy,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Old Hat</i>.

Voil�&#x2014;a picture book that exemplifies simplicity at its most creative and entertaining. The four words of the title, combined in various ways, form a visual tale as a bear juggles, interacts with, and ultimately eats an orange, pear, and apple. Stark white backgrounds set off Gravett's loosely brushed watercolor pictures of animal and fruit, which play off of the staccato words to demonstrate how punctuation and intonation can dramatically alter meanings: Apple, Pear goes with an image of stacked fruit, while Orange Bear shows the animal puzzling over his citrus-hued fur. Though the book's design appears artless, it is quite the opposite, skillfully juxtaposing page layouts to maximize the humor of the wordplay. Ideal for prereaders and helpful to those ready to write stories of their own, this will make children laugh and learn as they follow the bear's antics and chant the rhymed sequences of words.

Luther was a professor of Bible at the University of Wittenberg when he posted his famous 95 Theses (1517). In addition to writing many books, Luther translated the Bible into German. Luther believed that salvation was only by faith in Jesus, unmediated by the church. He challenged papal authority by emphasing the Bible as the only source of religious authority and believed the church to be a priesthood of all believers.These ideas helped to inspire the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization.

The 3rd generation Bishop, Pastor, Producer, Songwriter, and Vocalist, is while best known for his music, has dedicated his life to ministry and has led this generation to worship. Murphy&#x2019;s approach to radical ministry is most recognized by the soul stirring lyrics, and lead vocals on his Platinum Selling song &#x201c;Praise Is What I Do&#x201d;, and the recent Grammy Nominated &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Working&#x201d; Bishop Murphy faithfully serves as The Lead Pastor of The dReam Center Church of Atlanta, and as Bishop of Worship, for The Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship, International. He blesses people all around the world, with his ministry of music, message of hope and through his ministry of prayer. Bishop Paul S. Morton, Sr., Founding Bishop of The Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship, is quoted as saying, &#x201c;...This 21st Century David, has not only caused me to go to deeper depths in my time of worship, but he has blessed the lives of so many across the world.&#x201d; Praying Through It, the prayer and daily devotional is just another testament to Murphy&#x2019;s dedication to being a difference maker and changing the culture of the way we do church. Having started the mandate to prayer as a social media movement to get 1000 people praying, Murphy pulled the collection of prayers and heart-felt expressions all together in a book to further spread the message that &#x201c;prayer changes things&#x201d;. The ministry of William Murphy captivates the hearts and souls of believers around the world. His latest music single &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Working&#x201d; climbed the charts to #1, and has become one the most requested, and most played songs in gospel radio. Murphy is scheduled to release his 5th solo project, &#x201c;The Overcomer&#x2019;s Record in 2016 which includes the powerful single &#x201c;Let Us See Jesus&#x201d;. There is no doubt that Bishop William Murphy was born to worship.

In The Potty Book, Henry needs to have his diapers changed so he can go out and play. Then mom and dad bring home a big box, and Henry is anxious to open it up and see what&#39;s inside. Is it a rocking chair? A bed for Teddy? No, it&#39;s a potty--which means that it&#39;s time for Henry to graduate from his diapers. This gentle and humorous little story is charmingly illustrated and told in verse. Little boys will enjoy looking at the pictures and having the story read to them. Meanwhile, they&#39;ll start getting the idea that it&#39;s time for them to grow up, exactly like Henry.

These two are almost exact duplicates, both in text and illustration. The only differences are the names, Henry/Hannah; the addition or subtraction of a ponytail on the child's head; and the colors used-blue or pink, of course. A cutesy, rhymed text in the child's voice tells toddlers how Henry/Hannah receives his/her very own potty "to use when I am ready." Then the narrator goes on to relate how he/she sits on it, has success, and is rewarded with new underwear, not to mention the praise and applause of Mommy and Daddy. This is virtually the same plot as any other potty-training book aimed at this audience and their parents. Some have a tad more humor and imagination, like Wendy Lewison's The Princess &amp; the Potty (S &amp; S, 1994). Others are a bit more straightforward, such as Alona Frankel's Once Upon a Potty (Barron's, 1980). These two add nothing new or noteworthy or imaginative.

A funny, touching and triumphant story from an award-winning creative team. 2009 sees the 10th anniversary of this bestselling picture book loved by children everywhere.</p><p>Gerald the giraffe doesn't really have delusions of grandeur. He just wants to dance. But his knees are crooked and his legs are thin, and all the other animals mock him when he approaches the dance floor at the annual Jungle Dance. "Hey, look at clumsy Gerald," they sneer. "Oh, Gerald, you're so weird." Poor Gerald slinks away as the chimps cha-cha, rhinos rock 'n' roll, and warthogs waltz. But an encouraging word from an unlikely source shows this glum giraffe that those who are different "just need a different song," and soon he is prancing and sashaying and boogying to moon music (with a cricket accompanist). In the vein of <i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i>, Gerald's fickle "friends" quickly decide he's worthy of their attention again.<p> With this rhyming, poignant (in a cartoonish way) tale, Giles Andreae, author of <i>Rumble in the Jungle</i>, and numerous other picture books, shows insecure young readers that everyone can be wonderful, even those that march to the beat of a different cricket. The rhymes are somewhat awkward, but the bold, bright watercolors by Guy Parker-Rees will invite readers to kick up their heels and find their own internal harmony. (Ages 3 to 6) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Gerald the giraffe longs to dance, but his legs are too skinny and his neck is too long. His knees buckle whenever he tries to twirl. At the Jungle Dance, the warthogs waltz, the chimps cha-cha, and the lions tango. "Giraffes can't dance", they all jeer when it's Gerald's turn to prance.<p>Fortunately, there is one little creature who believes in Gerald. "Everything makes music", says the cricket, "if you really want it to". So Gerald starts swaying to his own sweet tune.</p><p>With light-footed rhymes and high-stepping illustrations, this tale is gentle inspiration for every child with dreams of greatness.</p></p><h2>Ask Powerful Questions: Create Conversations That Matter</h2><p>What is revealed when you authentically connect with the people around you?In <i>Ask Powerful Questions</i>, Will Wise explains how the questions we traditionally ask are virtually meaningless when it comes to establishing connection.

Engaging, cartoonish animals from tigers to pangolins romp across the pages as the rhyming text bounces along: &#x201c;Tails fluffy, / Tails stringy, / Scaled tails strong and&#x2014;clingy!&#x201d; Pull tabs, lift-able flaps, tufts of fur, and even a scratch-and-sniff skunk tail provide plenty of tactile surprises. Along the way, youngsters will learn about counting, opposites, and how animals use their tails. A tried and true tail-wagger!</p><p>The most fascinating part of an animal, in the minds of many young children, is the tail. Not only do kids lack such appendages, they've been told that, as tempting as they are to yank on, tails are not to be touched. Fortunately, this charming, texture-rich board book (with patches of real fake fur!) is the next best thing. A vast menagerie of cartoonish critters play and scamper around the pages of Matthew Van Fleet's <i>Tails</i> sporting tails of all types: bumpy alligator tails, fuzzy tiger tails, and even slightly stinky scratch-and-sniff skunk tails. Children can pull the tabs to make some of the tails wag or swish. The story line is minimal, as animals lounge about playing with one another and generally having good-natured fun. Catchy rhyming verse ("Tails fluffy, tails stringy, scaled tails strong and clingy. Tails long. Tails stumpy, pulling tails makes snoozers grumpy") keeps the action moving along and encourages young readers eager to turn the page. Shoddy construction can often spell doom for lift-the-flap and touch-and-feel children's books but <i>Tails</i> is every bit as well-designed as it is well-written and illustrated.

She&#x2019;s cool with her boss and coworkers, so they&#x2019;re cool with me and my sister, Ava, being at Ma&#x2019;s job after school.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, Ava chills for minutes. Me? Hours. I don&#x2019;t know why Ava doesn&#x2019;t hang longer. Maybe she&#x2019;s too busy with her ninth-grade life. But me? I like doing office things, like Ma: reading, being quiet, and chilling for forever. For example, about a month back, I found this empty spot at Ma&#x2019;s job and asked her if I could use it as my pretend-office. She asked her boss and she told Ma, &#x201c;Sure. We also have a spare desk-chair and some other supplies Bryan can use.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, right now, I&#x2019;m doing homework in my office, but this kid named Mike is at Ma&#x2019;s desk and I&#x2019;m distracted spying on him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;s a year older than me and about two inches taller. He rocks a sweater like mine, but his kicks are newer and more popular. He has hair like me, Afro-type if we grew it out. Mine&#x2019;s grown out a little since I need a cut. He just got one.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he&#x2019;s alone, but I&#x2019;ve seen him with his mom here, two or three times.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&#x2019;t think twice about Mike at first because a lot of kids and their parents come through here. Then I saw him at my school, hanging with seventh graders. He didn&#x2019;t do his sixth grade in my school. So, why&#x2019;d he transfer for his seventh grade? I asked Ma, and she said his family was in the Bronx and she helped them get an apartment here in Brooklyn in our projects.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In school, me and Mike nod what&#x2019;s up but don&#x2019;t hang. I see him around the neighborhood too and at the handball courts near us. Then the other day I saw him talking to my pops. I didn&#x2019;t get why Pa was so friendly to him. And I don&#x2019;t get why Mike is here now, talking to Ma.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I squint at them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did Mike just call Ma &#x2018;Ma&#x2019;?&#x201d; I ask Ava, who is in my office looking at my homework on my clipboard.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ava stares from the clipboard at him and shrugs. &#x201c;Who cares? Almost anyone younger than her calls her Ma.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#x2019;s true. Ma helps lots of people and they love her. But I don&#x2019;t like this kid Mike calling her Ma right now.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask Ava, &#x201c;Why&#x2019;s he playing her so close?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ava goes back to reading the clipboard, but I can&#x2019;t look away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike stares at Ma like she&#x2019;s his mom for real and gives her a hug.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yo! He better let go of my moms.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ava interrupts me and points at different spots on my clipboard. &#x201c;You spelled some stuff wrong.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What? Where?&#x201d; Nothing should be wrong because I checked it twice like Ma says to do. I look where she points.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugh! She&#x2019;s right. I hate when she&#x2019;s right.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grab a pencil, take the clipboard, and fix my mistakes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time I look up again, Mike&#x2019;s about to leave. He yells, &#x201c;Bye, Ma!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn to Ava. &#x201c;He just called her Ma again!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She rolls her eyes. &#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s probably her real son. Unlike you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here she goes again, cracking that stupid joke she&#x2019;s been cracking since I was in day care, telling me Ma and Pa found me in a trash can.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back then, I believed her since me and Ava have different complexions. Hers is chocolate brown. I&#x2019;m a lighter caramel.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time she said it, I ran to Ma and she showed me our birth certificates. Ava got punished but she never stopped joking I wasn&#x2019;t her brother&#x2014;like right now&#x2014;and for some reason it still bothers me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, I wish Mike was my real brother,&#x201d; she continues. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s no momma&#x2019;s boy like you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My whole head burns like I have a fever. I want to cut on her so hard. But only weak disses come to mind. I finally growl, &#x201c;Big Head.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oooh, Big Head. Ouch. I can&#x2019;t wait until Mike comes to eat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Eat?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What you think? He calls Ma Ma and he won&#x2019;t come eat soon? You know anyone who calls Ma Ma ends up eating with us. You saw how she hugged him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ma sneaks up on us. &#x201c;What is going on with you two?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shut up.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You both were going at it. Now you&#x2019;re quiet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bryan&#x2019;s mad because you hugged Mike.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ma makes a face like I&#x2019;m her baby and I have nothing to worry about. &#x201c;Come here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go over and she hugs me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to worry about Mike. You&#x2019;ll see tomorrow night. He&#x2019;s coming for dinner.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; <br><b> <br>Chapter 2</b><br><br>When I get back from school the next day, Ma tries handing me what looks like a grocery list. I U-turn to bounce.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bryan,&#x201d; she calls me back. &#x201c;Here. I need you to go to Hector&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sigh, turn around, and take her grocery list as thoughts fly through my head.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope there&#x2019;s no note for the bodega&#x2019;s owner.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope there&#x2019;s no note for the bodega&#x2019;s owner.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugh! There&#x2019;s a note for him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do I have to get groceries with a note and not real money? I wish I had brothers to get groceries.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, I do have brothers. Before Ma, Pa had three sons from another woman. But I don&#x2019;t even know what they look like. I used to imagine them. I pictured them stopping bullies from bullying me. I pictured them giving me money when I wanted candy. I pictured them teaching me boy stuff Pa didn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I&#x2019;ve stopped imagining them. They&#x2019;re not coming to Brooklyn for me, and they probably don&#x2019;t even know about me. Supposedly, they&#x2019;re grown and live in Philly or somewhere.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pa probably doesn&#x2019;t even know what his sons look like either. Ma says Pa left them when they were like nine or ten and he hasn&#x2019;t seen them since. Whatevs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I have to go get groceries. Not Ava. Not imaginary brothers. Me. And I hate it.<br> ***<br> I look at Ma&#x2019;s shopping list. &#x201c;Can I add chocolate powder?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sighs. &#x201c;Bryan, we&#x2019;re just getting what we need.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I need chocolate milk,&#x201d; I say. I look at the list again. &#x201c;Okay, how about grapes? We need them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We have.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They so shriveled,&#x201d; I joke, &#x201c;they raisins now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ma&#x2019;s in a serious mood. &#x201c;Money is tight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to say, If money is tight and we have to buy food on credit, why you inviting Mike to dinner?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I just take the list and head for the elevator. When it shows up, there&#x2019;s a puddle of piss in it. Instead of someone cleaning it up, it looks like heads did what they usually do&#x2014;keep trashing it. Junk-food wrappers and cigarette butts float on the puddle that stinks ammonia-strong.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take the stairs.<br> ***<br> Pa&#x2019;s friends hang out on the corner near the bodega.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His friend Pito lowers his sunglasses and waves when he sees me. Pito could pass for that basketball player Stephen Curry and always rocks skintight T-shirts that show off his abs, no matter how cold it gets outside.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bunch of other familiar faces spot me and their faces flip from hard to hi, but not much else flips. Loud Spanish music thumps. Teens who rock the most dip gear sit on milk crates. Some of Pa&#x2019;s real old&#x2014;viejo&#x2014;friends sit at a table and play dominoes and beef about the last move made.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Pa and his homeboys&#x2019; spot. I only come by when I&#x2019;m on my way to the bodega or the arcade next door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ava says I don&#x2019;t like to hang here because I&#x2019;m soft. That&#x2019;s why she calls me a momma&#x2019;s boy. I&#x2019;m not a momma&#x2019;s boy, but I am like Ma since she got me used to being by myself, the way she keeps to herself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Focus on school,&#x201d; Ma always tells me. &#x201c;There will be friends later. The wrong friends bring drama, and I don&#x2019;t want them rubbing off on you.&#x201d; Anyway, with all that advice, I wonder why she&#x2019;s letting Mike come over.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicholas, this black older man with dark skin and all-white hair like Magneto from the X-Men, puts his hand on my shoulder and nods at a crate. &#x201c;Sit! Sit!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No thanks,&#x201d; I tell Nicholas real kind. &#x201c;Ma and Pa want me back with the food.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicholas and Pa&#x2019;s friends circle me, smiling. Some are a bit bent with that same smell Pa has when he drinks. But the look in their eyes is the same: love. I know they have my back.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When me and Pa are here, he tells them, &#x201c;Look out for my son,&#x201d; and they swear they&#x2019;d body anyone who messes with me. Once, when Pa told Pito to look out for me, Pito lifted his fist, showed Pa his knuckles, and told him, &#x201c;Joe, you kidding me?

Out here, you need heads who got your back and it feels good that they got mine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go in the store.<br> ***<br> &#x201c;Bryan!&#x201d; Hector smiles at me while humming along to a Marc Anthony song playing loud from behind the counter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hand him Ma&#x2019;s shopping list. He stops humming, reads it, and bites his lip. &#x201c;Your father hasn&#x2019;t paid his last bill.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look away, wishing I wasn&#x2019;t here.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hector sighs and slides Ma&#x2019;s list on the counter back to me. &#x201c;Go ahead.

Hector might flip and say, &#x201c;My cat can do what she wants. You don&#x2019;t even have money. Be happy I let you get food.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk up to Mercedes and the bread.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hisses.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugh!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to grab a not-smushed bread, and Mercedes swats me mad fast!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yo! Her eyes look like she says, Get out my store with your broke butt.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I finally have everything, I go to the counter. Hector checks if the list matches what I got. I can&#x2019;t have nothing extra.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stare back at the chocolate powder we can&#x2019;t afford to buy. Chocolate milk tastes so good.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right then, this girl Melanie from my school comes in and watches as Hector bags my stuff and hands me a Post-it. &#x201c;This is how much your father owes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dang! Why&#x2019;d he have to mention us owing money? I nervous-smile at Melanie, and just like I thought, she eyes me all in my sauce and trying to know the flavor.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#x2019;s for her to figure out? I&#x2019;m a broke joke.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yo! I wish I could explode magician smoke in front of me and&#x2014;poof&#x2014;I&#x2019;d be gone and not here, all embarrassed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nod at Hector. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tell Joe I say hi.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside his store, I look above everyone&#x2019;s head&#x2014;above all the laughs, the arguing, and the music.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look toward Manhattan, and I wish things could be different.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish my family had more money.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish that girl didn&#x2019;t have to see me be broke.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I had a brother for real.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I wasn&#x2019;t in my feelings.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I didn&#x2019;t care so much.</p><h2>Chef's Guide to Herbs &amp; Spices: a QuickStudy Laminated Reference Guide (Quickstudy Reference Guide)</h2><p>Essential 6 page laminated kitchen-proof guide for both the professional chef and homegrown culinary enthusiast.

And while this is not an easy space to go through, when we are grounded in the truth, we can endure the tough times.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this powerful book, Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow passionately shares glimpses of his journey staying grounded in the face of disappointment, criticism, and intense media scrutiny. Following an exceptional college football career with the Florida Gators and a promising playoff run with the Denver Broncos, Tebow was traded to the New York Jets. He was released after one season. <br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Shaken</i>, named the 2017 Christian Book of the Year, Tebow talks about what he&#x2019;s learned along the way, building confidence in his identity in God, not the world. This moving book also features practical wisdom from Scripture and insights gained from others who have impacted Tebow in life-changing ways. <br>&nbsp;<br>Though traveling hard roads is not easy, it&#x2019;s always worth it!<br><br><b>Your Circumstances do not Define You,</b><br><b>Your Identity Does.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>What do you do when life takes an unplanned detour? When the unexpected happens? When doubt or negativity tries to rise above your faith? Most of us can relate to these questions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Through a dynamic lens of story and insight, Heisman trophy winner Tim Tebow tells what he&#x2019;s learned during the highs and the lows of his journey in the NFL. <i>Shaken</i> also features practical wisdom from the pages of Scripture and moving narratives of individuals&#x2014;from celebrities to cancer patients&#x2014;who have impacted Tebow&#x2019;s life. Their inspiring stories will encourage you also to tackle fear, overcome bitterness, and take on the obstacles life throws at you.</p></p><p><b>Tim Tebow</b>&nbsp;is a two-time national champion, first round NFL draft pick, and Heisman trophy winner.

Sure, I&#x2019;ve had my ups and downs. As I&#x2019;ve done things a little bit dif- ferently, the world has tried to force me onto a roller coaster of identities,&nbsp;defining me by my circumstances and not who I really am.<br><br>Was my identity found in the highs when I won the Heisman and later when the Denver Broncos were making a play-off run? No. Was my identity found when, a year later, I was cut? No.<br><br>One day, according to the world, I&#x2019;m on top of my game, adored, praised, and respected. And the next, I&#x2019;m at the bottom of the heap, cut, criticized, and torn down. You know what I&#x2019;ve learned in the process? How important it is not to allow either the highs or the lows in life to determine who you are.<br><br>It&#x2019;s tempting to define ourselves or to measure our worth by the external&#x2014;by how much money we have, by how we look, by the applause of others. The list is long. Think about this. Who are you when everything is going&nbsp;great&#x2014;when the money is in the bank, when your home life is peaceful, when your future seems certain? And who are you when your world is shaken&#x2014;when your bank account is overdrawn, when your relationship is on the fritz, when you haven&#x2019;t a clue what tomorrow holds? Sometimes it takes a challenging time to really find out. <br><br>While many know about my career highs, few know the details about the lows. Like having to learn that God&#x2019;s plans are better and bigger than mine, feeling torn about the future, and working through my dreams being shattered after getting cut from three NFL teams. I admit, writing this book hasn&#x2019;t been easy. It was tough to relive some painful moments. But I&#x2019;ll say that in those places of doubt and even of darkness, I&#x2019;ve realized that who I am has nothing to do with wins or losses, applause, or negative criticism. It has to do with whose I am. Knowing this, I can live out what the king of ancient Israel wrote in Psalm 16:8:<br><br> I have set the Lord continually before me;<br> Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.<br> &nbsp;<br> While in this book I share parts of my personal life and football journey in the NFL, this is not a memoir. It&#x2019;s about the truth I&#x2019;ve discovered along the way. And, it&#x2019;s also about some amazing people I&#x2019;ve been inspired by in life as well as through our foundation&#x2019;s W15H (pronounced &#x201c;wish&#x201d;) outreach pro- gram. Though our mission is to bring faith, hope, and love to those needing a brighter day in their darkest hour of need, they have, without fail, given those very things to me. While I wish I could tell you about every single child and family I&#x2019;ve met who has inspired me, I&#x2019;m excited to be able to share a few stories with you.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s what you can expect to find in this book. The first seven chapters&nbsp;will reveal some of the lows I&#x2019;ve experienced, glimpses into my life and parts&nbsp;of myself that I&#x2019;ve never shared publicly. They&#x2019;ll also uncover the lessons I&#x2019;ve learned through that time, like what it means to stay grounded in the face of doubt, fear, and criticism; why others matter; and how our objective in life is not to be like everyone else. <br>The final three chapters move in an outward trajectory, focusing on how we can impact others in our journey of faith and purpose. When we are grounded in whose we are, not only can we handle the storms that come, but we can also begin to move forward in a more purposeful direction. We can begin to live in a new way. We can impact others even when our circum- stances look bleak. We can use our stories to help others in their own.<br><br>Look, I&#x2019;m not perfect. I&#x2019;m on a faith journey just like you are. I have good days. I have bad days. Sometimes I get it right. Other days I struggle. I know that when I&#x2019;m settled in my identity, I live at my best.<br><br>While this book doesn&#x2019;t offer cookie-cutter answers or a concrete plan about what to do when you stand on shaky ground, my prayer is that it strengthens your faith, gives you hope, and shines light on your dark places. My prayer is that after reading this book, you can walk away inspired, armed&nbsp;with courage, ready to tackle life, and make a difference.</p><h2>All My Stripes: A Story for Children With Autism</h2><p>Gold Medal, Mom's Choice Awards<br><br> "It teaches us to embrace not only who we are, but also to embrace the people around us who are brilliantly different thanks to their own amazing, colorful stripes."&#x2014;Stan Lee, Chairman emeritus of Marvel Comics<p><i>Nobody gets me, Mama!</i></p><p>Zane the zebra feels different from the rest of his classmates.

By putting words to the things God has shown&nbsp;<em>him</em>&nbsp;through some amazing experiences, John Eldredge helps readers shed light on the miraculous truths that God is showing&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;right now.</p><p>Our deepest need is to live in conversation with God. To hear his voice. To follow him intimately. This is the single most life-changing habit that a human being can adopt, because it brings us back to the source of life. Yet most Christians have never been taught how to have a conversation with the Creator.</p><p>In this revised and updated edition of his classic&nbsp;<em>Walking with God,</em>&nbsp;John Eldredge opens his personal journals to tell a year&#x2019;s worth of stories about walking and talking with the Lord.</p><p>Some of John&#x2019;s stories will help readers recall lessons they didn&#x2019;t know had been forgotten, some will open up new horizons, but they will all help readers tell and interpret their own story: the story of their intimate walk with God.</p></p><p><p>John Eldredge is a bestselling author, a counselor, and a teacher. He is also president of Ransomed Heart, a ministry devoted to helping people discover the heart of God, recover their own hearts in God&#x2019;s love, and learn to live in God&#x2019;s kingdom.&nbsp;John and his wife, Stasi, live near Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>For bestselling evangelical author Eldredge (<i>Wild at Heart</i>), Christians are meant to inherit the kind of intimacy that Adam and Eve had with God in the Garden of Eden, but the belief that God only speaks through the Bible hinders a Christian's ability to experience that intimacy. Drawing from a year's worth of journaling about his walk with God, Eldredge models how talking to God is as easy as checking daily to ask, What are you saying, Lord? Sometimes when Eldredge queries God, God's response confounds him. For example, when God responds repeatedly with two words, My love, it takes an accident and a personal epiphany for Eldredge to understand that God wants him to rebuild [his] personality based on [God's] love. Through everyday life lessons, personal anecdotes and a lot of scripture, Eldredge shows how Christians can get into direct conversation with God, encouraging readers to ask for answers about anything and everything. Eldredge's story (as opposed to chapter) format is supposed to better help readers to pause along the way at those points where God is speaking to you, but it results in a lack of real organization and may make it difficult for readers to uncover an overarching theme in the course of a section. <i>(Apr. 15)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Until he came along, there was nothing very special about life in Sutton, Indiana.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Styx came to us like magic&#x2014;�the really, really powerful kind. There was no grand puff of smoke or anything, but he appeared as if from nowhere, right in our very own woods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe we summoned him, like a superhero responding to a beacon in the night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe we just plain wanted everything he offered. Adventure. Excitement. The biggest trouble we&#x2019;ve ever gotten into in our lives, we got into with Styx Malone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t Styx&#x2019;s fault, entirely. And usually I&#x2019;d be quick to blame a mess like this on Bobby Gene, but no matter how you slice it, this one circles back to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It all started the moment I broke the cardinal rule of the Franklin household: Leave well enough alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>���</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was Independence Day, which might have had something to do with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I woke up with the sunrise, like usual. Stretched my hands and feet from my top bunk to the ceiling, like usual. I touched each of the familiar pictures taped there: the Grand Canyon, the Milky Way, Victoria Falls, Table Mountain. Then I rolled onto my belly, dropped my face over the side of the upper bunk and blurted out to Bobby Gene, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what Dad says. I don&#x2019;t want to be ordinary.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I knew he was awake. His eyes were open and blinking up at me. He had his covers pushed down and his socks balled up in his fist. He must&#x2019;ve heard me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I said, I don&#x2019;t want to be ordinary. I want to be&nbsp;. . . the other thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What other thing?&#x201d; Bobby Gene said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I rolled onto my back. &#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t really know what I meant, but it was on my mind because of what happened last night at dinnertime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dad got home from his shift at the factory around six, which was normal. He turned on the television, piping through the house the sound of news reports about things that were happening so far from here that they barely seemed real. The reporters were always blabbing on about economics and politics and the constant breaking news.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But every once in a while I would see something that made me want to reach through the screen and touch it, you know? Like to get closer to it, or to make it a little bit real. There was a story about dolphins one time. And a feature about a group of kids who sailed a boat around the world. Special things. Things you&#x2019;d never find in Sutton.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The problem was, Dad was always talking about us being ordinary folks&#x2014;�about how ordinary folks like this and ordinary folks need that. He usually said all this to the TV, but our house isn&#x2019;t that big and his voice is pretty loud so you can always hear him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Ordinary folks just need to be able to fill the gas tank without it breaking them.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Ordinary folks go to church on Sundays.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Ordinary folks don&#x2019;t care who you&#x2019;ve been stepping out with; just pass the dang laws.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(A lot of times he said it more colorful than that, but I&#x2019;m not allowed to repeat that kind of language.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That night in particular he was getting all hot and bothered, as Mom would say. He was ranting at the TV and Bobby Gene and I were playing Battleship behind the couch. Sneaking back there was a tight fit for us, but we needed to practice undercover operations.

This groundbreaking novel was like nothing else out there?it was honest and gritty, and was a deeply sympathetic portrayal of Ponyboy, a young man who finds himself on the outside of regular society. Forty years later, with over thirteen million copies sold, the story is as fresh and powerful to teenagers today as it ever was.<p> Celebrate the fortieth anniversary of a classic with this stunning edition, featuring the original cover.<br><br></p></p><p>According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for &#34;social&#34;) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he&#39;s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy&#39;s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser. This classic, written by S. E. Hinton when she was 16 years old, is as profound today as it was when it was first published in 1967.Ponyboy is fourteen, tough and confused, yet sensitive behind his bold front. Since his parents&#39; death, his loyalties have been to his brothers and his gang, the rough, swinging, long-haired boys from the wrong side of the tracks. When his best friend, Johnny, kills a member of a rival gang, a nightmare of violence begins and swiftly envelops Ponyboy in a turbulent chain of events.</p><h2>Birds of Minnesota Field Guide (Bird Identification Guides)</h2><p><p><b>Learn to Identify Birds in Minnesota!</b> </p><p>Make bird watching even more enjoyable.

A great swimmer, but its legs are set so far back that it has a hard time walking. &#x201c;Loon&#x201d; comes from the Scandinavian term lom, meaning &#x201c;lame,&#x201d; for the awkward way it walks on land. To take off, it faces into the wind and runs on the water while flapping. Its wailing call suggests wild laughter, which led to the phrase &#x201c;crazy as a loon.&#x201d; Also gives soft hoots. In the water, young ride on the backs of their parents for about 10 days. Adults perform distraction displays to protect the young. Very sensitive to disturbance during nesting and will abandon the nest.</p></p><h2>You Have to F*****g Eat</h2><p>A <b><i>New York Times</i></b> Best Seller<br><br>One of <b>BookRiot</b>'s Must-Read Books from Indie Presses for 2014<br><br>One of <b>Flavorwire</b>'s 50 Best Independent Fiction and Poetry Books of 2014<br><br>"<i>You Have to F***ing Eat</i> makes parents of picky eaters smile."<br>--<b><i>TODAY Parents</i></b><br><br>"Adam Mansbach...will delight exhausted and exasperated parents everywhere for a second time with <i>You Have to F**king Eat</i>--another children's book that is most definitely not for children."<br>--<b><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br><br>"An equally hilarious ode to kids at the table."<br>--<b><i>Huffington Post</i></b><br><br>"Parents, Adam Mansbach gets you.

Born in Melbourne, Australia, on February 22, 1962, he was raised on the wildlife park his parents owned. He cared for the animals and especially loved reptiles--he got a python for his sixth birthday! At nine years old, Steve was already helping his father wrestle small crocodiles. He became a crocodile trapper after graduating high school, catching the creatures before dangerous poachers could. Steve met his wife, Terri, at his family's park, and instead of a honeymoon, the pair filmed a wildlife documentary that led to the creation of the well-known series <i>The Crocodile Hunter</i>. Tragically, Steve was killed on September 4, 2006 while filming a documentary when a stingray attacked, piercing his heart. He was forty-four years old. However, his life's work obviously still strikes a chord with kids who voted him the winner of the 100th Who Was...? title.</p><p>Dina Anastasio is the author of Pirates, Apollo 13, Flipper Junior Novelizations, A Question of Time, and many other books.<p></p><p>Who Was Steve Irwin?</p><p></p></p><h2>Snowmen at Christmas</h2><p><i>Snowmen at Night</i> shared with us the magical, slip-sliding adventures of snowmen after dark . . . but have you ever wondered what snowmen do for Christmas?

Upcoming collaborations include an original fairy tale about a lonely princess who decides to become a hairdresser. They live in Utah with their nine children.PreS-K. One of the more charming new books of the holiday season, this reintroduces the jolly snowmen (and women) from <i>Snowmen at Night</i> (2002)<i>.</i> This time they are enjoying the Christmas season, venturing out during the moonlit night (while children sleep) to gather in the town square. It's not what happens here (primarily a visit from a snow Santa and some carols 'round a tree) but the rich art that makes this special. As in the previous book, Buehner does magical things with light in his paintings. From the cover, where snow people frolic in the moody blues of evening to the scene of a city street where holiday lights cast a mellow glow to the quiet picture of a lightening morning sky, children will be enchanted by the hues of the acrylic artwork. The text is sprightly with a to-the-point rhyme scheme that only occasionally verges on singsong. Little ones, especially, will enjoy the celebration as the snow people relish their special night. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Intended to provide this frequently regarded &#x201c;lost generation&#x201d; of young men with words of encouragement and guidance, Harper&#x2019;s deep-rooted passion regarding the plight of today&#x2019;s youth drove him to write this book, sure to change the lives of readers for years to come.<br><br></p></p><p>Currently starring in <i>CSI: NY</i>, Hill Harper has appeared in numerous prime- time television shows and feature films, including <i>Beloved</i> and <i>He Got Game</i>.

He also holds a master&#x2019;s degree in public administration from the Kennedy School of Government. He was recently named one of <i>People</i> magazine&#x2019;s Sexiest Men Alive.Inspired by Rainer Maria Rilke's <i>Letters to a Young Poet</i>, Harper, a young black actor and graduate of Brown University and Harvard Law School, offers similar inspiration to young men clamoring for advice and encouragement at a time when popular culture offers little positive direction. Interspersed throughout are e-mail inquiries from young men and Harper's responses and those of other celebrities, including Nas, Venus Williams, and Barack Obama. He devotes separate chapters to school and work, sex, and life aspirations, tackling such issues as single parenthood, sexually transmitted diseases, the allure of materialism, and the power of words and faith. Harper offers his personal story: a young man brought up by a demanding father, who developed a relationship with his mother only as he grew older. He views the youth of today as an evolved species, like the latest model car, with improvements that come from the experiences of those who came before. Although aimed at young black men, this book, with its contemporary language and approach, should have appeal for youth of both sexes and all races. <i>Vernon Ford</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Forced to confront what medicine knows about cancer, and all that we still do not know, Servan-Schreiber marshaled his will to live and set out to understand the complex inner workings of the body&#x2019;s natural cancer-fighting capabilities. He soon found himself on a decades-long journey from disease and relapse into scientific exploration and, finally, a new view of health.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Anticancer </i>is at once the moving story of one doctor&#x2019;s inner and outer search for wellness and a radical exposition of the roles that lifestyle, environment, and trauma play in our health. Drawing on the latest research in integrative medicine that blends conventional and alternative approaches, Servan-Schreiber concisely explains what makes cancer cells thrive, what inhibits them, and how we can empower ourselves to prevent their growth. His advice details how to develop a science-based anticancer diet (and the small changes that can make a big difference); how to reap the benefits of exercise, yoga, and meditation; which toxic, unsafe products to replace in your home; and how to stave off the effects of helplessness and unhealed wounds to regain balance.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Anticancer</i>&#x2019;s synthesis of science and personal experience marks a transformation in the way we understand and confront cancer.

He codirected an NIH laboratory for the study of cognitive neuroscience and published more than ninety articles in scientific journals. His pioneering book&nbsp;<i>Anticancer: A New Way of Life</i>&nbsp;became an international bestseller and was translated into more than forty languages. He is also the author of <i>The Instinct to Heal </i>and <i>Not the Last Goodbye</i>. Servan-Schreiber died in July 2011, leaving us a profound legacy of new understandings and pioneering work in disease prevention.<b>Foods That Act Like Medications</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From <i>ANTICANCER: A New Way of Life </i> by David Servan-Schreiber, MD, PhD</p><br><i><p><b>Foods That Act Like Medications</b></p></i><p>If certain foods in our diet can act as fertilizers for tumors, others, to the contrary, harborprecious anticancer molecules. As recent discoveries show, these go far beyond the usual vitamins,minerals, and antioxidants.</p><p>In nature, when confronted with aggression, vegetables can neither fight nor flee. To survive,they must be armed with powerful molecules capable of defending them against bacteria,insects, and bad weather. These molecules are phytochemical compounds with antimicrobial,antifungal, and insecticide properties that act on the biological mechanisms of potentialaggressors. They also have antioxidant properties that protect the plant&#x2019;s cells from dampnessand the sun&#x2019;s rays (by preventing cellular &#x201c;rust&#x201d; from forming when the cell&#x2019;s fragile mechanismsare exposed to the corrosive effects of oxygen).</p><i><p><b>Plums, Peaches, and Nectarines: It&#x2019;s Time for Stone Fruit</b></p></i><p>Berries have recently found some competition: peaches, plums, nectarines, etc. (collectivelyknown as stone fruit), whose anticancer virtues were previously unknown. According to agroup of researchers in Texas who reviewed more than a hundred species, these fruits&#x2014;particularlyplums&#x2014;are at least as rich in anticancer elements as small berries. In this time ofeconomic recession, it&#x2019;s good to know that a single plum contains as many antioxidants as ahandful of berries and costs far less. In laboratory tests, stone fruits have also demonstratedtheir efficacy against breast cancer cells and cholesterol.</p><i><p><b>Probiotics</b></p></i><p>The intestines ordinarily contain &#x201c;friendly&#x201d; bacteria, which help digestion and facilitate regularbowel movements. They also play an important stabilizing role for the immune system.Among the most common of these bacteria are <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus </i> and <i>Lactobacillusbifidus</i>.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that these probiotics inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells.Their effect on the facilitation of bowel movements also lowers the risk of colon cancer by reducingthe time the intestines are exposed to carcinogenic substances in food. Probiotics thusalso play a role in detoxification. In addition, according to a 2006 Korean study, probiotics improvethe performance of the immune system, as well as increasing the number of NK cells.Organic yogurts and kefir are good sources of probiotics. Soy yogurts are usually enrichedwith probiotics. These precious bacteria are also found in sauerkraut and kimchi.Finally, certain foods are prebiotics, which means they contain polymers of fructose, whichstimulate the growth of probiotic bacteria. Examples are garlic, onions, tomatoes, asparagus,bananas, and wheat.</p><i><p><b>Green Tea</b></p></i><p>Rich in polyphenols, including catechins (and particularly epigallocatechin gallate-3, orEGCG), which reduce the growth of the new vessels needed for tumor growth and metastases.It is also a powerful antioxidant and detoxifier (activating enzymes in the liver that eliminatetoxins from the body), and it facilitates the death of cancer cells by apoptosis. In the laboratory,it enhances the effects of radiotherapy on cancer cells.</p><i><p><b>Turmeric and Curry</b></p></i><p>Turmeric (the yellow powder that is one of the components of yellow curry) is the most powerfulnatural antiinflammatory identified today. It also helps stimulate apoptosis in cancercells and inhibit angiogenesis. In the laboratory, it enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapyand reduces tumor growth.</p><p>Take note: To be assimilated by the body, turmeric must be mixed with black pepper(not simply with peppers). Ideally, it must also be dissolved in oil (olive, canola, or linseed oil,preferably). In store-bought curry mixes, turmeric represents only 20 percent of the total. Soit&#x2019;s better to obtain turmeric powder directly.</p><p>Recommendations for use: Mix � teaspoon of turmeric powder with � tablespoon ofolive oil and a generous pinch of black pepper. Add to vegetables, soups, and salad dressings.A few drops of agave nectar can remove the slightly bitter taste.</p><i><p><b>Ginger</b></p></i><p>Ginger root also acts as a powerful antiinflammatory and an antioxidant (more effectivethan vitamin E, for example) and has protective effects. It acts against certain cancer cells.Moreover, it helps reduce the creation of new blood vessels. A ginger infusion tea also helpsalleviate nausea from chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</p><p>Recommendations for use: Add grated ginger to a vegetable mix while it is cooking in awok or frying pan. Or marinate fruits in lime juice and grated ginger (a touch of agave nectarmay be added for those who prefer more sweetness). Make an infusion by cutting a smallpiece of ginger (about an inch) into slices and steeping in boiling water for ten to fifteenminutes. Can be drunk hot or cold.</p><i><p><b>Cruciform Vegetables</b></p></i><p>Cabbages (brussels sprouts, bok choy, Chinese cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.) containsulforaphane and indole-3-carbinols (I3Cs), which are powerful anticancer molecules. Sulforaphaneand I3Cs are capable of detoxifying certain carcinogenic substances. They preventprecancerous cells from developing into malignant tumors. They also promote the suicideof cancer cells and block angiogenesis. In 2009, at the Cancer Research Center of the Universityof Pittsburgh, biologist Dr. Shivendra Singh and his team studied the impact of sulforaphane&#x2014;an antioxidant contained in cruciform vegetables&#x2014;on prostate cancer in mice.</p><p>They made two radical new discoveries. First, consumption of sulforaphane three times aweek considerably increases the action of NK cells against tumors (by more than 50 percent).Second, tumor-carrying rats that consumed sulforaphane were shown to have half as muchrisk of developing metastases as those that did not.</p><p>Take note: Avoid boiling cabbage and broccoli. Boiling risks destroying sulforaphaneand I3Cs.</p><p>Recommendations for use: Cover and steam briefly or stir-fry rapidly in a wok with alittle olive oil.</p></p><h2>Lovers Oracle: Heart-Shaped Fortune Telling Cards</h2><p><p>Bestselling artist and author Toni Carmine Salerno's <em>Lovers Oracle</em> has been completely revised and expanded with this new edition featuring 45 heart-shaped fortune telling cards for lovers and those in search of love.</p> <p>This stunning set, featuring new artwork and expanded and new messages, now also comes with an instructional booklet detailing how to use the cards as well as providing some sample card spreads.</p></p><p><p>Toni Carmine Salerno is the creator&nbsp;of many books, meditation recordings, and oracle cards.

First appearing in 1787 as a series of letters to New York newspapers, this collective body of work is widely considered to be among the most important historical collections of all time. Although the authors of <i>The Federalist Papers</i> foremost intended to influence the vote in favor of ratifying the Constitution, in Federalist No. 1 Hamilton explicitly set their debate in broader political terms. &#x201c;It has been frequently remarked,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.&#x201d;</p> <p></p> <p>Among the many highlights of these acclaimed essays is Federalist No. 10, in which Madison discusses the means of preventing rule by majority faction and advocates for a large, commercial republic. This is generally regarded as the most important of the eighty-five essays from a philosophical perspective, and it is complemented by Federalist No. 14, in which Madison takes the measure of the United States, declares it appropriate for an extended republic, and concludes with a memorable defense of the Constitution. In Federalist No. 70, Hamilton advocates for a one-man chief executive, and in Federalist No. 78 he persuasively lays the groundwork for the doctrine of judicial review by federal courts.</p> <p></p> <p>Though centuries old, these timeless essays remain the benchmark of American political philosophy. As eloquently stated by famed historian Richard B. Morris, <i>The Federalist Papers</i> serve as an "incomparable exposition of the Constitution, a classic in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any later American writer."</p></p><p></p><h2>The Operator: Firing the Shots that Killed Osama bin Laden and My Years as a SEAL Team Warrior</h2><p>This instant <i>New York Times</i> bestseller&#x2014;&#x201c;a jaw-dropping, fast-paced account&#x201d; (<i>New York Post</i>) recounts SEAL Team Operator Robert O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s incredible four-hundred-mission career, including the attempts to rescue &#x201c;Lone Survivor&#x201d; Marcus Luttrell and abducted-by-Somali-pirates Captain Richard Phillips, and which culminated in the death of the world&#x2019;s most wanted terrorist&#x2014;Osama bin Laden.<br><br>In <i>The Operator</i>, Robert O&#x2019;Neill describes his idyllic childhood in Butte, Montana; his impulsive decision to join the SEALs; the arduous evaluation and training process; and the even tougher gauntlet he had to run to join the SEALs&#x2019; most elite unit.

You can find him at RobertJONeill.com.The Operator CHAPTER ONE<p></p> <br>I owe my career as a Navy SEAL to a girl. I&#x2019;m not the first, and I doubt I&#x2019;ll be the last.<br> <br>She was younger than I was, a brunette with the face of a supermodel, great dance moves, and&#x2014;key to my heart&#x2014;a quick sense of humor. The first time I tried to kiss her, I closed my eyes too soon and I heard her say, &#x201c;Uh, what are you doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna kiss you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not before you ask me out, you&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you go out with me tomorrow then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pick me up at seven o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; she said, then gave me a better kiss than I deserved and went home.<br> <br>The next evening I picked her up at 7:00 sharp and, big spender that I was, drove her to Taco Bell. She ate a large order of Nachos Bellgrande and three soft Tacos Supreme.<br> <br>Gorgeous girl, perfect figure, and the appetite of a lumberjack. I knew nothing about life, but I thought I was in love.<br> <br>When I graduated high school in Butte, Montana&#x2014;the same school my grandfather and father had graduated from&#x2014;and enrolled at Montana Tech, the local college, this girl was still a junior. It&#x2019;s just one of those things; you&#x2019;re not going to date a high school girl when you&#x2019;re in college. So I stayed away, but I couldn&#x2019;t keep my mind off her. She went on doing her high school thing, dating and going to dances, which she damn well should have been doing. But I wanted it both ways, me having my fun and her staying on hold. I simmered miserably for weeks, then finally snapped when I heard she&#x2019;d spent the day with some high school boy. With a couple drinks in me I went to her house to find out what was going on, and promptly made a complete ass out of myself.<br> <br>Her father, a massive Italian with black hair, a burly mustache, and a square jaw, was famous around Butte for being tough. He owned a company that jacked up entire houses and moved them whole. I was certain he would have no problem moving me. But he took pity. Instead of knocking me flat, which would have been more than justified, he gently but firmly escorted me out the door.<br> <br>That kindness provoked something of an out-of-body experience. After he released his iron grip from my elbow and sent me reeling into the night, I glimpsed myself as if from a distance. It wasn&#x2019;t an attractive sight. I realized that if I was acting like this now, it would only get worse. I&#x2019;d end up as one of those guys who hang around Butte forever, whining about the good old days.<br> <br>So I knew. I had to go.<br> <br>In my very limited experience, the way people got out of Butte was by joining the military. Though I&#x2019;d never really considered it before, in that instant I was committed. The future, or fate, or whatever, kicked into high gear.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>THESE DAYS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT call my childhood &#x201c;free range.&#x201d; Saturday mornings I was out the door after breakfast and back only when the streetlights amped up. Kids ran in packs in my neighborhood. We ambushed each other with toy guns and played ninja warriors, leaping off rooftops and doing a bunch of other harebrained stuff I&#x2019;d kill my kids for doing. We all went to see Rambo at the Butte Plaza Mall. That was pretty cool. Everybody wanted to be that guy blowing away evildoers with his M60. But to me, it was all fantasy, no more real than the increasingly sophisticated shooter video games that competed for our attention. The actual military was never huge in my life. I was never going to be in it, so I didn&#x2019;t think much about it. I just wanted to play, put on camouflage, and pretend to shoot my friends.<br> <br>At first glance, Butte might not seem like an idyllic place to grow up. It&#x2019;s a mining town whose best years were in the early twentieth century, when every bullet in every rifle sent Over There during World War I was made of copper&#x2014;most of it mined in Butte. The population hit a peak of 100,000 in 1920 and by the time I came along had dipped by about two-thirds. The residential areas mingled with pit mines, and the entire town was built on a plateau next to the biggest pit of all, Berkeley Pit, an immense, defunct, open-pit copper mine a mile wide and a third of a mile deep. Between the time it opened in 1955 and its closure on Earth Day 1982, a billion tons of ore and waste rock had been wrenched out of its depths. When the sump pumps shut off for the last time, ground water began a slow rise, leaching acids and heavy metals from the gaping wound in the earth. The water that filled the pit was toxic enough to kill any geese that possessed the poor judgment to splash down there. Eventually, the Berkeley Pit was declared the largest Superfund toxic waste site in the country.<br> <br>But I was more focused on other features of Butte, specifically metal hoops that hung ten feet above gymnasium floors, and the deer, elk, and antelope that sprinted through the wild Rockies, which rose up like a frozen tsunami on the other side of town.<br> <br>My dad, the son of a miner, was a stockbroker and my mom was a math teacher (I took her class three times&#x2014;in seventh and eighth grades and again in high school). My parents divorced when I was six or seven. To me, having two parents who lived apart seemed almost natural. I don&#x2019;t remember their living together. My dad was always close by and around whenever we needed him, but the usual setup was to go with him every other weekend. That was fine with my siblings and me; all of our friends were near my mom&#x2019;s house and we liked to have weekends to play outside: kick the can, war, ninjas, or climbing and roof-jumping. We all played together, except the climbing and jumping. Kris, my elder sister, wanted none of that. But I could force my sister Kelley, younger than me by three years, to come along. She desperately wanted to fit in. So up we went on the roof, and off we jumped. These days I&#x2019;d give my son an earful if he pulled that shit, but being a kid, I didn&#x2019;t think about the risk. It was just fun. Kelley was my best friend for years; I even made her sign a contract binding her to being my teammate for two-on-two football on the church lawn. She was a damn good receiver and one hell of an athlete all through college.<br> <br>My older brother, Tom, was a complete dick up until he was in high school. Then some switch flipped and he became awesome. Or maybe I just stopped being so annoying. Whatever. Some magic happened and he became the funniest person I knew, and All-State in cross-country. He taught himself guitar and his first band was called The Fake ID&#x2019;s. That&#x2019;s how young they were. He still plays and has his own morning show on a local radio station.<br> <br>Kris was always the most levelheaded of us, but my mom will disagree. Maybe they were too much alike, and sometimes sparks flew. Kris was always tolerant of me, easy to talk to, and the best laugher I&#x2019;ve ever known. She was meticulous, got straight A&#x2019;s forever, and was gentle&#x2014;when she wasn&#x2019;t kicking my ass, which she could do up to my junior year in high school&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. possibly longer.<br> <br>My mom and dad maintained a cooperative, cordial relationship throughout my childhood. If they had any big problems with each other, they never let my siblings or me see it. The split living was actually good for my parents. My mom worked at the junior high, which was next to the high school so she could get us to school and home. She loved being a mom, but she got every other weekend off to go out on the town with her crazy, fun, and hot friends Lynn and Sue. I remember them sitting at my mom&#x2019;s kitchen table, sipping daiquiris and talking about what went down on Saturday night. It was too much for my tender junior high ears. I was in the next room and I had to low crawl my ass out the front door because I couldn&#x2019;t take it. My first mission.<br> <br>We loved hanging out with Dad on those alternate weekends. He was a total bachelor but we didn&#x2019;t realize it. We should have guessed because our first stop on Friday was always to Buttreys&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a local grocery store. We needed food because he had none! He went out for most meals. So we&#x2019;d go down every aisle and grab stuff we needed, going heavy on the junk food and making sure to grab ingredients for Dad&#x2019;s &#x201c;Famous Breakfast.&#x201d; His scrambled eggs were and still are incredible. Cheese, mayo, butter, basil, and some secret stuff. One time we forgot milk so he added Amaretto Coffee-mate. Don&#x2019;t try it! We&#x2019;d always end the weekend at Grampa Tom and Gramma Audrey&#x2019;s. She cooked like a champ; everything you can imagine. And this is where I learned my dad&#x2019;s trick: potato mountain and gravy lake!<br> <br>As I was growing into adolescence, my dad and I developed an unusual father&#x2013;son relationship, becoming more like best friends. It began when my mom moved us from up on the &#x201c;hill&#x201d;&#x2014;where all my neighborhood buddies lived&#x2014;to a place downtown, not far from the Berkeley Pit, where I didn&#x2019;t know anybody. I was looking for something to replace all those ninja hijinks with my friends when I saw a video&#x2014;Michael Jordan&#x2019;s first, Come Fly with Me. I was instantly captivated. It begins with Jordan all alone, shooting baskets in a completely empty gym. His voice-over says, &#x201c;I could never stop working on it. Each day I feel I have to improve.&#x201d; And then of course there are endless scenes of Air Jordan, defying gravity, cutting through defenders as if they&#x2019;re no more substantial than the atmosphere itself.<br> <br>I was awed, inspired. I wasn&#x2019;t the biggest kid, or the best-looking, or the smartest or most athletic, but something inside me connected with that obsessive drive to keep striving. Looking back, I guess I had that all along. My favorite subject was English, and my favorite book was The Old Man and the Sea. I liked the way Santiago, the old fisherman, is drawn into a titanic battle of wills with the huge fish. His hands are shredded by the fishing line, he&#x2019;s so hungry he&#x2019;s eating slices of raw bait, he hasn&#x2019;t slept, his muscles are cramping there in his crappy little boat, but he&#x2019;ll die before he quits. That attitude appealed to me.<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t going to hook any giant marlins in Butte, Montana, but I could aspire to be like Mike. There was a school right next to my new house, Greeley Elementary, with an outdoor basketball hoop. So I asked my mom to get me a basketball and she did. I would go over there every day and play by myself, hours at a time, just seeing how many free throws in a row I could make, working on my jump shot, driving left, driving right. My dad, who was about forty then, had played some at the University of Montana. He was a damn good basketball player. He found out what I was doing and he said, &#x201c;Hey, do you want to start playing?&#x201d;<br> <br>We played at a sports club in downtown Butte. I&#x2019;d still shoot by myself at the elementary school, and then he&#x2019;d pick me up and we&#x2019;d hit the club. I was spending four hours a day, seven days a week with a basketball in&#x2014;or flying out of&#x2014;my hands. When I made the school team I practiced with my teammates during the season, and when it ended, Dad&#x2019;s and my private season began. Dad picked me up after school and took me to the indoor court. We&#x2019;d practice two or three hours; dribbling, layup drills, one on one, wildly raucous pickup games. He tried to teach me everything he&#x2019;d learned, head fakes, little tricks he&#x2019;d picked up on how to beat your man.<br> <br>When we were finally exhausted, my dad would say, &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t leave until one of us sinks twenty free throws in a row.&#x201d; He would feed me&#x2014;I&#x2019;d get pissed if he made me move my feet even an inch off the line&#x2014;and I&#x2019;d shoot till I missed. Then he&#x2019;d take over. The first time it took about twenty minutes for one of us to make twenty in a row. Then we went out for a steak dinner to celebrate. The next day my dad said, &#x201c;We can leave when one of us gets twenty, but we need twenty-five for the steak.&#x201d; Once we hit twenty-five, it went up to thirty, then thirty-five, forty. We got to where we had to make seventy free throws in a row for a dinner, and we almost always did it. I think my dad&#x2019;s record was ninety in a row. Mine is still 105. We were making a lot of free throws.<br> <br>When I was twelve, my dad got divorced from his second wife, and my uncle Jack, his brother, persuaded him to give hunting a try on weekends to get his mind off failed marriages. There was no question I&#x2019;d come with him. We went driving up the mountain in Jack&#x2019;s Nissan. We didn&#x2019;t know what we were doing at first. There are vast plains up there with magnificent animals sprinting all over at warp speed&#x2014;antelope are pretty much the fastest animal in North America. Guys in trucks and four-wheelers chase them and people shoot in every direction. If I were to see it today from the perspective of a range officer at Naval Special Warfare Development Group, I&#x2019;d recognize how insanely unsafe it is. But it was thrilling, and eventually we got good at it, climbing on foot to a place no trucks could go, a place where we knew the animals would retreat at the end of the night. You take up a position out of the wind and let them come to you, take them by surprise. The animals expect to be chased, not ambushed.<br> <br>My first kill was a mule deer, a big buck. I remember driving up these terrible dirt roads in the dark, climbing the edge of a valley as far as we could, then walking steeply uphill as the sun rose. After about an hour, we hit the summit, which descended into a hay-colored bowl. That&#x2019;s where we hoped to run into the deer. There weren&#x2019;t any. We hung out for a while and the disappointment of not finding anything to shoot at faded. It was late fall, chilly but not bone-numbing, patches of snow here and there, and I thought: Not bad to be sitting up on this mountaintop at the break of day, just me and my dad, as if this amazing place had been waiting for us to arrive.<br> <br>Eventually we got hungry. As we were walking back down the hill for lunch, a doe and a buck burst out of the trees into a clearing a hundred yards to our right. We were shuffling along, making a sound the buck didn&#x2019;t recognize. He froze right in the middle of the clearing. My dad was in front of me, right in the line of fire. He dropped to the ground and said, &#x201c;Take it!&#x201d; I was fortunate I didn&#x2019;t have time to think about it. I knew I needed to take the shot now or he was gone. The adrenaline took over. Still standing, I raised my .300 Winchester Magnum to my shoulder and barely glimpsed the buck in my scope before I pulled the trigger. My father had told me to aim for his chest, right behind his shoulder. You want to try to hit him in the lungs for a quick kill. I missed high, a lucky shot. The bullet severed his spine. That worked. The buck dropped right where he stood. We approached carefully. These big bucks can play dead. You don&#x2019;t want them to hop up and trample you. I stuck out my foot and gave him a nudge. The flesh of his haunch quivered, but otherwise he stayed put. I took another step toward his big antlered head, and raised the muzzle of my rifle&#x2014;the same kind of rifle I&#x2019;d eventually use as a SEAL sniper&#x2014;to his big staring eyeball. Dead all right.<br> <br>It was a bit surreal for me. He looked the same as he had just a moment ago when he was alive: pretty colors and noble antlers. But he was dead, and I&#x2019;d killed him. I felt a tug of remorse. He was a beautiful animal, gone now thanks to me. But I was also proud. This was Montana. Deer were for shooting. Everybody did it. Now I was part of the club.<br> <br>In the hunting seasons that followed, any residual remorse fell away. Soon it was a competition at junior high every Monday. &#x201c;So and so got a buck.&#x201d; The real prize was the bull elk.

Soon they're having weekly poetry sessions and, one by one, the eighteen students are opening up and taking on the risky challenge of self-revelation. There's Lupe Alvarin, desperate to have a baby so she will feel loved. Raynard Patterson, hiding a secret behind his silence. Porscha Johnson, needing an outlet for her anger after her mother OD's. Through the poetry they share and narratives in which they reveal their most intimate thoughts about themselves and one another, their words and lives show what lies beneath the skin, behind the eyes, beyond the masquerade.</p><p>Open Mike Friday is everyone's favorite day in Mr. Ward's English class. On Fridays, his 18 high-school students dare to relax long enough to let slip the poets, painters, readers, and dreamers that exist within each of them. Raul Ramirez, the self-described "next Diego Rivera," longs "to show the beauty of our people, that we are not all <i>banditos</i> like they show on TV, munching <i>cuchfritos</i> and sipping beer through chipped teeth." And while angry Tyrone Bittings finds dubious comfort in denying hope: "Life is cold. Future?...wish there was some future to talk about. I could use me some future," overweight Janelle Battle hopes to be seen for what she really is: "for I am coconut / and the heart of me / is sweeter / than you know" They are all here: the tall girl, the tough-talking rapper, the jock, the beauty queen, the teenage mom, the artist, and many more. While it may sound like another <i>Breakfast Club</i> rehash, Grimes uses both poetry and revealing first-person prose to give each character a distinct voice. By book's end, all the voices have blended seamlessly into a multicultural chorus laden with a message that is probably summed up best by pretty girl Tanisha Scott's comment, "I am not a skin color or a hank of wavy hair. I am a person, and if they don't get that, it's their problem, not mine." But no teen reader will have a problem with this lyrical mix of many-hued views.

The coordinated focus of these materials is unique: biblical content, provocative questions, systematic theology, practical application, and the gospel story of God&#x2019;s grace presented all the way through Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;These <em>Knowing the Bible</em> volumes introduce a significant and very welcome variation on the general run of inductive Bible studies. Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A. Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T.
